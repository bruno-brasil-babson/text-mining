['Alice and Jack Chambers are a young, happy couple in the 1950s, living in an idyllic neighborhood of the company town of Victory, California, which has been created and paid for by the mysterious company of the same name for which Jack works. Every day, the men go to work at Victory Headquarters out in the surrounding desert, while their wives (Alice, her friend Bunny, the pregnant Peg, newcomer Violet, and Margaret) stay home to clean, relax, and prepare dinner for their husbands. The women are discouraged from asking questions about their husbands\' work, and are told not to venture out to Headquarters due to the "dangerous materials" the company works with: Margaret has become an outcast among the other wives after taking her son out into the desert, resulting in her son\'s apparent death. Margaret claims that Victory took her son from her as punishment, but these claims are dismissed by the others as a trauma-induced paranoia. While attending a party hosted by Frank, Victory\'s enigmatic founder and leader, Alice sees Margaret\'s husband attempting to give her medication. Later, while Alice and Jack secretly have sex in Frank\'s bedroom, Alice realizes Frank is observing them but says nothing.\n\nOne morning, while riding the trolley across town, Alice witness a red Biplane crash somewhere out in the desert. Alice disembarks and rushes into the desert to help, accidentally stumbling on Victory Headquarters - a small building covered in mirror-like windows. After touching one of the windows, she experiences surreal hallucinations before waking up back home later that night to find Jack preparing their dinner. In the following days, Alice begins to experience increasingly strange occurrences: she is almost crushed between a window and a moving wall, and she finds a box of eggs to be filled only with hollow shells. She receives a phone call from Margaret, who claims to have seen the same thing Alice had. Later, during a dance lesson lectured by Frank\'s wife Shelley, Alice sees a vision of Margaret violently banging her head against a mirror: she rushes back to their neighborhood just in time to see Margaret slit her own throat and fall from the roof of her house. Alice is dragged away by strange men in red jumpsuits before she can reach Margaret\'s body.\n\nAlice attempts to explain the events to Jack, but Jack dismisses it, explaining that Margaret simply fell while cleaning the windows and is perfectly fine and recovering in hospital with her husband, who has been forced to leave the Victory project in order to take care for her. This version is further corroborated by the town physician Dr. Collins, who claims to have treated Margaret and attempts to give Alice the same prescription drugs. Alice later breaks into Dr. Collins\' briefcase and finds a heavily-redacted medical file for Margaret, which she then burns in frustration. Alice becomes increasingly paranoid and confused, feeling as if Frank is watching her every move. During a special Victory event in which Frank gives Jack a special promotion, Alice has a breakdown in the bathroom and is comforted by Bunny. Alice attempts to explain everything to Bunny, but Bunny reacts angrily, accusing Alice of being selfish and attempting to ruin everything for everyone, pointing out she sounds "just like Margaret."\n\nSome time later, Alice and Jack invite the rest of the neighborhood (except Bunny and her husband Bill) to dinner, with Frank and Shelley as special guests. Frank speaks privately with Alice in the kitchen, intimating that she\'s right in her suspicions, and confessing that he\'s been waiting for someone like her to challenge him. Spurred on by Frank\'s confession, Alice attempts to expose him and the inconsistencies in Victory over dinner. Instead, Frank gaslights her, making her look delusional to the other guests. In the aftermath, Alice begs Jack to take them both away from Victory. Jack initially agrees, but when Alice gets in the car, he lets her be taken away by Frank\'s men. Dr. Collins forces Alice to undergo electroshock therapy. During the procedure, Alice sees visions of herself in another life - as a present day surgeon named Alice Warren, who lives with the unemployed Jack and struggles to make ends meet.\n\nAlice returns to Victory, apparently cured of her "hysteria", and reunites with Jack and with Bunny. However, as Alice resumes her normal life, she continues to have hallucinations and flashbacks. Alice later remembers the whole truth: that Victory is a simulated world created by Frank, and that Jack has kidnapped her and forced her into the simulation in the hope they can lead a perfect life together. When Jack realizes she knows the truth, he claims he did this for her as she was miserable in her real life, but Alice is enraged that Jack took away her autonomy. Jack hugs Alice, begging her to forgive him, but begins to crush her, and Alice kills him with a glass tumbler in self-defense, killing Jack in the real world as well.\n\nFrank is alerted to Jack\'s death and sends his men to capture her. Alice is found with Jack\'s body by Bunny, who explains that she has known all along that Victory is a simulation but chooses to stay so she can be with her children, who are dead in real life. Bunny tells Alice to flee to Victory Headquarters, which is an exit portal from the simulation, and holds off Bill when he attempts to attack Alice for killing Jack. The other wives gradually begin to realize the truth as their husbands start to panic. Alice steals Jack\'s car and drives out towards Victory Headquarters, chased by Dr. Collins and Frank\'s men. She tricks Dr. Collins into killing himself and several others in a car crash. At their house, Shelley stabs Frank to death, claiming it is now "her turn". Alice makes it to Victory Headquarters, where she encounters a vision of Jack asking her to stay. Alice ignores the vision and rushes to the window just before Frank\'s men reach her. Over a black screen, the sound of Alice gasping for air is heard, implying she escaped.']
["The movie opens with Reggie Kray coming out of an apartment in East End London and bringing a cup of tea to 2 policemen sitting in a car. A narration from a woman informs us that one of the policemen is named Nipper Read. The policemen are watching Reggie and are annoyed that he openly mocks them for tailing him. Reggie walks down the street to get one of his associates who didn't show up for work that day, his driver Frank. Another associate, Albert or Albie, is following in Reggie's car. At Frank's apartment his sister Frances, who is doing the voice-over, greets Reggie and it is obvious Reggie is attracted to her. Frances' mom comes to the door and tells him to get lost as Frank arrives downstairs. They drive down the street a ways and Reggie and Albie get out then walk thru a winding alleyway and lose the police tail. Next we see Ronnie, Reggie's moments-younger twin brother, telling Reggie and Albie a story about willing someone to give him their pudding and it working. This serves as an illustration that Ron is not a clear-minded individual. The narrator informs us that Ron was serving a prison sentence for grievous bodily harm but he has been remanded to a psychiatric facility as insane. Now Reggie wants Ron declared sane so he can leave so next we see an enforcer named Pat, nickname Big Pat, in a shrink's office making a subtle threat. Next we see that psychiatrist before the parole board saying Ron should be released. After he's released the psychiatrist tells Reggie that Ron is dangerous and gives Reg medicine for Ron to take daily or he warns there will be big trouble.\n\nNext we see Reggie picking up Frances for a date, of which her mother openly voices her disapproval. He takes her to an East End club that he owns where he explains he invites celebrities to come hang out with some of the rough characters from around town and they show up because it makes them feel edgy. At the club Reggie is pulled away to deal with Jack, a manager who's been stealing from the take on one of their drug operations. Reggie is surprisingly lenient with Jack, simply telling him to pay the money back and stop stealing, then returns to his date with Frances. Frances asks if he enjoys being a gangster and Reggie denies it, saying he's simply a club owner. Some time later Reggie takes Frances to meet Ron and he promptly informs her that he's homosexual.\n\nNext we see the beginnings of a turf war between Charlie Richardson, a South London gang leader, and the Krays. After a couple of minor dust-ups the Krays are invited to a parlay on neutral ground to settle it without more bloodshed. It turns out to be a set-up where Reggie and Ronnie are vastly outnumbered. After Ron uses a ruse to slip out, Reggie starts the fight and is holding his own until Ron shows up again with weapons and together they begin to savagely beat the men sent to hurt them. Next we are introduced to the Krays lawyer, Leslie Payne, who helps them arrange legitimate business operations to help cover for their illegal activities. Frances' narration tells us that Reggie liked Payne and considered him a useful and necessary partner but that Ron was always open in his dislike and distrust of him. Using Payne the Krays purchase interest in a casino that Reggie intends to use to become a legitimate businessman, a plan which Ron eschews because he enjoys being a rough-and-tumble gangster. Payne informs the twins that the American mafia has made inquiries in order to establish a working relationship with whomever is ruling the London underworld. Ron isn't interested in working with them but Reggie has Payne set up a meeting, which goes well and an arrangement is reached. Following scenes accompanied with Frances' voiceover tell us that the new casino is doing very well, making lots of money and accomplishing Reggie's goal of establishing him as a legitimate businessman. At the casino the same business plan as before is in place, with celebrities mixing company openly with gangsters. At the same time the brothers continue with various gangster activities like money laundering and protection rackets, among others. It's at this point that Reggie has to return to prison to finish out a sentence that had been on appeal but was now due to be finished. Reggie is viciously beaten by the guards in prison but he fights back. Ron tells Frances Reggie doesn't want visitors but she goes anyway, making Reggie angry.\n\nWhile Reggie is in prison Ron proceeds to ruin the business at the club because he doesn't want them to have a legitimate business, he wants to be a gangster. When Reggie gets out he proposes to Frances then he and Frances visit the club. Reggie is incensed at how Ron has ruined their money making enterprise and berates him in front of all their business associates. In response Ron ruthlessly insults Frances, causing Reggie to start a very violent fight. Later we see Reggie showing Frances a West End club that he intends to buy, again to reestablish himself as a businessman. In the meantime scenes show that Ron's homosexual lifestyle has brought him into frequent contact with at least a couple of members of the House of Parliament. This creates a difficult situation for the police who can't bust the Krays for fear that their links to the Parliament will be exposed. Frances' narration tells us that this influence helps them to get out of a more than a few legal difficulties over the years.\n\nReggie and Frances get married but Frances' narration tells us problems arose almost immediately. Despite his legitimate business ventures, Reggie is still drawn to and receives lots of money from his and Ron's gangster pursuits like drugs, protection rackets, money laundering, etc. This keeps him away from Frances for a great deal of time. In addition Ron and Mrs Kray, their mother, make it clear to Frances that they don't think much of her. As a result Frances becomes very despondent over her situation, increasingly turning to drugs to help her cope. On the business front, Ron is increasingly volatile, acting out irrationally on multiple occasions and necessitating Reggie step in to hold things together. Complicating things is Ron's refusal to take his medicine because he enjoys feeling and acting violent. When one of Richardson's Southie thugs tries to muscle in on Kray territory, Ron commits cold-blooded murder in front of a room full of people. Nipper Read, who has been promoted to Scotland Yard, is put in charge of the investigation and commits to bringing down the Krays. Initially this case goes nowhere because all the witnesses are too intimidated by the Krays to testify. When Reggie makes it clear to Frances that he intends to continue with all his illegal activities despite her wishes that he quit, she leaves him then soon after commits suicide.\n\nFor no apparent reason other than he doesn't like him, Ron hires Jack to kill Leslie Payne but Jack botches the job, sending Payne to the police. Because of Payne's tremendous involvement in all their various schemes it invigorates the investigation, resulting in the police gathering a large number of witnesses into protection. Shortly after the botched assassination attempt Reggie confronts and kills Jack at a party at Ron's house with several witnesses present. With Payne and the other witnesses, the police finally have enough evidence to prosecute the Krays and overcome their previous influence with the Parliament. A graphic at the end shows Reggie was convicted and sent to prison until he was granted compassionate release just 2 months prior to his cancer-related death in 2000. Ron was convicted, declared insane and remained committed until his death in 1995."]

['"Watchmen" is set in an alternate 1985 America in which costumed superheroes are part of the fabric of everyday society, and the "Doomsday Clock" -- which charts the USA\'s tension with the Soviet Union -- is permanently set at five minutes to midnight. When one of his former colleagues is murdered, the masked vigilante Rorschach, washed up but determined, sets out to uncover a plot to kill and discredit all past and present superheroes. As he reconnects with his former crime-fighting legion -- a ragtag group of retired superheroes, only one of whom has true powers -- Rorschach glimpses a wide-ranging and disturbing conspiracy with links to their shared past and catastrophic consequences for the future. Their mission is to watch over humanity... but who is watching the Watchmen?\n\n==========================================\n\nBefore the credits, a mid-60\'s man in a bathrobe, puffing on a cigar, sits alone in his apartment watching PBS\' The McLaughlin Group discuss a potential nuclear war with Russia. A tall slim figure breaks into the room. The two start to fight. After they trade blows the assailant is clearly getting the upper hand, and he hurls the man in the bathrobe out the window of his high-rise. He is killed when he hits the ground, and a smiley face button soon lands on the pavement next to his body.\n\nThe opening credits show historical pictures as Bob Dylan\'s "Times They are a Changin" plays. Masked, costumed vigilantes fight crime in America. In the 1930s and \'40s, the vigilantes formed a group called the Minutemen to "finish what the law couldn\'t." The original lineup was heroic and helped catch criminals and win World War II. But they often suffered early and violent deaths in action, or became suicides, or were arrested for breaking the law themselves, or in one case were committed to an asylum.\n\nWe see a blue, other-worldly man shaking hands with President Kennedy; later we see a cigar-puffing man who might be the bathrobed man at the start of the movie (a bit younger) holding a rifle on the "grassy knoll" after Kennedy has been shot. And, in the glass of the helmet of the astronaut on the moon\'s surface, we do not see an American flag; we see the blue man again with a camera.\n\nA second generation of heroes has formed, called the Watchmen. We see them being photographed -- as the movie goes on, we will learn that these are the Comedian (a burly guy with a simple mask over his eyes and chomping on a cigar), Laurie Jupiter (the new Silk Spectre), Dr. Jon Osterman (Doctor Manhattan, the naked blue humanoid, with true superpowers), Adrian Veidt (Ozymandias, whose costume is like that of a Greek god), Daniel Dreiberg (the new Nite Owl, looking somewhat like Batman), and Rorschach (in a trench coat and hat with a knitted mask that completely covers his face and displays constantly changing ink blots).\n\nTV news reports that Nixon has been elected to a third term. By the 1980s, public opinion has turned against costumed heroes, who are considered a dangerous alternative to the police.\n\nIt is October 12, 1985. Investigating the murder of the man who fell to his death at the start of the movie, who we now know is Eddie Blake, Rorschach enters the crime scene apartment with a sophisticated grappling gun. Searching the apartment, he discovers the uniform, weapons and memorabilia of the Comedian, a former member of both the Minutemen and the Watchmen. We hear the voice over of what Rorschach will write in his journal: "Tonight, a comedian died in New York. Somebody knows why." He has to beat up a couple of policemen to get out of the building.\n\nMeanwhile, Daniel Dreiburg is at the home of Hollis Mason, the original Nite Owl. The two have regular meetings and talk about old times. Hollis says that it all started with the gangs. The Minutemen were a masked response to the masked gangs. They discuss the Comedian\'s death and Rorschach\'s vigilante activities. Nixon\'s policies don\'t allow masked vigilantes, but this hasn\'t stopped Rorschach.\n\nAs Daniel leaves, they see a report about Rorschach and the policemen on television. Daniel leaves in the rain and goes home, where he finds that Rorschach has broken into his home, and is in his kitchen. Rorschach shows Daniel the smiley face button that he found where the Comedian was killed. They go down to the Nite Owl lab, under Daniel\'s home, where Rorschach speculates that someone is killing the superheroes. Daniel says "The Watchmen are over" and that Rorschach could give it up since no one knows who he is.\n\nIn his journal, Rorschach speculates that nuclear war is coming.\n\nThe rich and brilliant Adrian Veidt is being interviewed. The reporter observes that only Adrian and Hollis ever revealed their true identities. Adrian talks about developing renewable energy sources, and that if he could eliminate fear of not having enough, war would be obsolete. Daniel is watching the interview, and he warns Adrian that someone may be after the Watchmen. Adrian is not worried. Adrian speculates that a being like Dr. Manhattan, with his powers that can control atomic structure, might be able to stop much of a nuclear strike, but not all of it.\n\nThe next evening, Rorschach sneaks into the US Army Rockefeller Military Research Center to warn Dr. Manhattan and Laurie Jupiter who live there in private quarters. Manhattan can normally see the future, but he says that he cannot see it now due to temporal interference caused by tachyons moving through time that may have resulted from a nuclear holocaust. He transports ("zaps") Rorschach outside the military facility in mid-sentence when he upsets Laurie; Rorschach challenges Laurie\'s judgement of the Comedian, who once tried to rape her mother. Rorschach refers to the incident as a "moral lapse". Manhattan then tells Laurie that he has been working with Adrian to solve the energy crisis in an effort to avert the war. Manhattan reads her mind, and observes her parents fighting (we see this same scene repeated twice more in the movie). He also tells Laurie that he knows she wanted to have dinner with him, but that she will instead be going out to dinner with Daniel.\n\nWhen Laurie arrives at the restaurant, Daniel is obviously smitten. They have dinner and talk about the old days. She observes that the Keene Act, which outlawed costumed vigilantism, has prevented them from going out as superheroes. Laurie confides that Jon (Dr. Manhattan) is becoming more remote. As she gets in a cab to leave the restaurant, Daniel observes that she is being watched by a "government escort". She responds that they don\'t want her upsetting the country\'s most valuable asset.\n\nAt a cemetery, the Comedian is given a funeral with military honors, while Simon and Garfunkel\'s "Sounds of Silence" plays.\n\nLaurie is teleported to her mother\'s home by Dr. Manhattan, where she immediately throws up into the toilet. The older woman, Sally Jupiter, observes that she thought Laurie would have gotten used to that means of travel by now. "It beats flying coach," says Sally. She is drinking margaritas in the afternoon and reminiscing about her old Minuteman days, when she was the original Silk Spectre. She shows Laurie a pornographic comic that is based on Sally\'s super-hero of the 1940s (the original Silk Spectre). Laurie is appalled by her mother\'s behavior.\n\nIn a flashback, Sally remembers the original Minutemen having a group photo taken in a wood-paneled club. Afterward, Sally goes to the billiards room to change out of her costume and the Comedian enters, making suggestive advances toward her. Sally tries to push him away but the Comedian brutally punches her and is ready to rape her when another member of their team, Hooded Justice, intervenes and beats Blake severely. Blake suggests that Justice gets off on beating men and Justice stops. Sally concludes the flashback with a cryptic observation about Eddie Blake.\n\nBack at the rainy cemetery, Dr. Manhattan and Daniel are there. Manhattan remembers that during the Vietnam War, the Comedian and Manhattan fought the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army, turning the tide of the war and allowing the United States to win. In a bar, as the war is over, a Vietnamese woman confronts the Comedian and tells him she is pregnant with his child. When the drunken Comedian refuses to take responsibility and insults her, she slashes his face with a broken bottle, causing a permanent scar. Infuriated, and over Manhattan\'s pleas for him to stop, the Comedian shoots and kills the woman. Blake then berates Manhattan for not stopping him, claiming that his failure to act shows that Manhattan doesn\'t really care about humanity.\n\nAdrian also watches the coffin being laid to rest and remembers a meeting of the Watchmen. He recalls that the Comedian was a sarcastic, misanthropic pessimist, while Ozymandias wanted to help humankind. The Comedian burns Adrian\'s display, saying that the threat of nuclear war trumps any efforts by the "Crimebusters" group Adrian wants to form.\n\nDaniel recalls a time when the Comedian and the Night Owl tried to calm a rioting group of protesters during a police strike; the comic gleefully fought with the protesters and shot tear gas at the people. Daniel, obviously bothered by the way lawlessness has engulfed the nation, asks the Comedian "What happened to the American Dream?" Amidst the destruction caused by the mob, the Comedian answers "It came true! You\'re lookin\' at it." Blake also mentions that Congress was enacting new legislation that would outlaw costumed vigilantes.\n\nA tall, wizened man pays his respects and goes back to his flat by an adult movie theatre. He is "Moloch", a one-time "arch-enemy". In his home, he is assaulted by Rorschach, who wants to know why Moloch went to the funeral. Moloch says that Eddie Blake had broken into Moloch\'s house a week before, very drunk, and had cried and rambled about a list.\n\nLaurie and Jon are having an intimate erotic moment when Laurie realizes Jon has replicated himself. At first, she is put off by making love to two people at the same time, but then she realizes that a third Jon is working on the energy design at the same time. Angry at not having his full attention she throws an object through the blue figure\'s head. Laurie leaves as Jon teleports the machine to Adrian in Karnak, his Antarctic stronghold. Laurie goes to Daniel\'s house saying she has nowhere else to go. He is going to meet Hollis for their weekly session and invites her to join him.\n\nJon dresses in a suit and tie (without physically touching his clothes) and zaps himself over to a TV studio for an interview. At the same time, while Dan and Laurie are walking to Hollis\', they are confronted by a large gang of street thugs. Dressed in their street clothes, they defend themselves with vigor.\n\nSimultaneously, at the interview, Manhattan is accused of afflicting many of his former colleagues with cancer. His once very close girlfriend, Janie Slater, appears and reveals that she too is stricken, and she damns Jon in public. In the ensuing press scrum, Jon screams "leave me alone", and he zaps everyone out of the studio.\n\nLaurie and Daniel\'s fight with the thugs ends, and she decides not to continue on to Hollis\'. Daniel and Hollis watch the end of Manhattan\'s interview on television. Hollis remarks that Manhattan was "crucified" in front of a national audience.\n\nDr. Manhattan teleports himself to Mars. There he recalls many events in a haphazard order. Years ago he had a loving relationship with Janie; he reassembled a watch with his father; he was trapped in an atomic chamber by a time lock before a lab accident turned him from a human scientist, Jon Osterman, into Dr. Manhattan; how he fell in love with Laurie.\n\nManhattan is slowly "resurrected" as a nervous system, a skeleton, and finally, a blue humanoid. TV news reports "The superman exists and he is an American". Dr. Manhattan is told he needs a logo, and he draws a circle with a dot in the middle on his forehead, a symbol of a hydrogen atom. President Nixon enlists his help to end the Vietnam war, which he does.\n\nThe TV reporter now denies that he said the quote about Superman. Instead, he says, that his words are "God exists and he\'s an American". The flashbacks end, and Dr. Manhattan observes that he is tired of humans, and he begins to build a large, watch-like device on Mars.\n\nLaurie is confronted by government officials for "not doing her job" (appeasing Dr Manhattan both physically and emotionally) and allowing him to leave Earth. In a flashback, while dressed as the Silk Spectre, she meets the Comedian. Her mother intervenes and tells him to stay away from her daughter.\n\nNixon, Kissinger and the war cabinet consider the recent events with the Soviet Union and prepare for war. Nixon seems willing to lose the East coast in a nuclear war with the Soviets, and he tells them to begin fueling America\'s bomber planes. Nixon says Dr. Manhattan has two days to solve the problems, and he "hopes he\'s on our side".\n\nLaurie tells the government officials that the only one who can bring back Jon is himself.\n\nLee Iaccoca and other industrial leaders have a disagreeable meeting with Adrian. Adrian reminds them of his brilliance, and how he has had a desire to be like Alexander the Great and unify the world. He also says he\'s wealthy enough to buy them several times over and tells them they can leave. As Iaccoca apologizes, the elevator door opens, and a deliveryman starts shooting. Veidt eludes the bullets, one of which hits Iaccoca between the eyes, and subdues the shooter but the man swallows a poison pill, froths at the mouth, and dies.\n\nLaurie and Daniel discuss the attack as they lunch at the Gunga Diner. Daniel says that it is not safe for the former heroes, and as they leave the diner, he suggests Laurie move in with him, for safety. She agrees, and they leave the diner. We hear Rorschach\'s voice over, in which he says that he is watching them walk away, but not in his costume.\n\nRorschach later reviews the ID card of the man who tried to kill Adrian. The man worked for Pyramid International and Rorschach remembers he had seen a letter from Pyramid earlier at Moloch\'s apartment. He returns to Moloch\'s apartment, but he discovers that Moloch is so recently dead that his cigarette is still smoldering. The police have the building surrounded and know that Rorschach is inside. Realizing he\'s been set up for the murder, Rorschach makes a torch out of a spray can and fights his way out of the building. Nonetheless, he is captured and unmasked. He is identified on the TV News as Walter Kovacs, age 35.\n\nWalter is jailed for the murder of Moloch until sentencing. The state psychiatrist, Dr. Malcolm Long, tells Walter that he won\'t want to be in the general population, because criminals he captured will want to get even. He gives Walter a psych assessment. As Walter looks at ink blots, he recalls moments in his life. At an early age, he sees his mother kissing a man. She slaps him and says that she "should have had that abortion." We also see a young Walter seriously injure much bigger kids who are taunting him. Walter resents being called "Walter" by the psychiatrist, and he talks about how evil society is. He recalls a seminal event, when he was a young Rorschach, and he uncovered the grisly murder of a 6-year old girl by a pedophile. Finding a cleaver at the scene of the crime, he brutally cleaves the murderer\'s head in two with multiple blows. He tells Long that "Walter died that night" and only Rorschach remains. Long leaves, saying "I can\'t help him." In prison, Walter is taunted by another inmate on the food serving line, and Walter splashes him with hot grease from a deep fryer, burning him horribly. Rorschach screams to the rest of the population "I\'m not locked up in here with you, YOU\'RE LOCKED UP IN HERE WITH ME!"\n\nLaurie snoops around in the basement of Daniel\'s building, and she finds the Night Owl\'s lab and his flying machine. She pushes a random button that activates the ship\'s flamethrower, starting a fire in the lab. Daniel comes down to help her put out the fire. He tells her that the ship is called "Archie" after Merlin\'s pet owl, Archimedes. He says that he inherited a lot of money from his father who was disappointed that he became a crime fighter. Daniel tells Laurie that Hollis was his hero. She tries on the night vision owl goggles, and she says that this must be how Jon sees. Daniel looks disappointed and goes upstairs. Laurie follows and tells him "Jon sees a lot of things, but he doesn\'t see me." The two make love on the sofa as Daniel observes that they may be going too fast. Laurie says that they have all the time in the world. A newscast in the background reports the buildup of Soviet tanks.\n\nLocked in his cell, Rorschach is taunted by a dwarf, Big Figure, a crime kingpin he had arrested 15 years earlier, now looking for revenge. Big Figure tells Kovacs that he can wait as long as necessary to get into his cell.\n\nDaniel has a strange dream in which he and Laurie are naked on a field under the stars. She pulls off their "skin" revealing their superhero costumes as a nuclear explosion goes off and vaporizes them. He awakens, and Laurie finds him staring at his Night Owl gear. The two decide to get into costume, take Archie out and "do something stupid". Archie flies around the city as they listen for police messages. They hear of a burning building and go to rescue a group of people trapped on an upper floor. Night Owl drops her into the burning building and then lines up Archie as she sends all of the trapped people into the ship, just a moment before an explosion would have killed them all. After dropping off the passengers, Daniel puts the flyer on autopilot and the two superheroes have steamy sex in the aircraft.\n\nMeanwhile, a prison riot is taking place. One of the dwarf\'s large henchmen attempts to grab Kovacs behind the bars. Rorschach grabs and binds the man\'s hands to the bars. Another henchman comes with a grinder and proceeds to first cut the others arms off and then cut open Rorschach\'s cell bars.\n\nWe cut to Laurie and Daniel in the aftermath of their lovemaking. They decide to try to rescue Rorschach from prison.\n\nBack at the prison, Rorschach quickly subdues the grinder man against the cell toilet and the dwarf runs for his life.\n\nBack in costume, Silk Spectre and Night Owl land at the prison where a full scale prisoner revolt is in progress. Meanwhile, Rorschach heads straight for the psychiatrist\'s office and gets his mask. Silk Specter and Night Owl arrive and subdue dozens of prisoners with fists and kicks. We see the dwarf run into the men\'s bathroom to hide, as Silk Spectre and Night Owl find Rorschach. Before he leaves, he says "Excuse me, I have to visit the men\'s room". For a moment, we see Big Figure through the swinging door, and we see water and blood running on the floor after Rorschach leaves.\n\nBack in Daniel\'s basement lair, Night Owl and Laurie revel in the fun of their evening. Dr. Manhattan appears and zaps Laurie to Mars with him. As he says how beautiful it is, she doubles over and throws up.\n\nNight Owl and Rorschach go out again and find out that Janie Slater, who worked for Pyramid, hired Adrian Veidt\'s assassin. They decide to "follow the money".\n\nSally calls Hollis, and Hollis tells her that the news is reporting Night Owl and Silk Spectre\'s rescue of the people trapped in the burning building. They revel in the joy of their proteges. Immediately afterwards, young thugs, knowing that Hollis was the original Night Owl, break into his apartment. He fights valiantly, but they kill him.\n\nRorschach and Night Owl argue, but Rorschach offers his hand in friendship, and they agree to go out in costume looking for the person who tried to kill Adrian. They hear on the TV news that Hollis has been murdered, and Night Owl badly beats up a gang member, even though he is not sure who killed Hollis.\n\nOn Mars, Manhattan tells Laurie what she is going to tell him, and she observes that "the most powerful thing in the universe" is "just going through the motions." She apologizes for sleeping with Dan, and remarkably, Manhattan seems unaware. He explains that "My red world here means more than your blue one," as his machine emerges behind them.\n\nIn the War Room, Nixon orders Def Con 1 to send the bombers.\n\nRorschach and Night Owl break into Adrian\'s office. Night Owl guesses that the password to Adrian\'s computer is "RamesesII" and they find out that Pyramid is owned by Adrian\'s company, Veidt International.\n\nIn Antarctica, at Karnac, a group of scientists raise a toast to Manhattan\'s energy reactor, which is now online. Adrian, dressed as Ozymandias, compares the scientists to the Egyptian servants who were buried with their pharaoh, as he steps over their poisoned bodies. A moment later he has them disintegrated in a manner similar to Jon Osterman\'s accident. Back in NYC, Rorschach records his suspicions in his journal, which he drops through mail slot in the door of the "New Frontier" newspaper.\n\nOn Mars, Laurie pleads for help for the Earth. Manhattan says that "The universe will not even notice" and that "Life is overrated". He wonders how things are better with another oil pipeline or shopping mall. She tells him to send her back to Earth to be "fried" with her mother and Daniel. She challenges Manhattan to "do that thing you do" and confront her with details of her life that she doesn\'t want to remember. Probing her memories, Manhattan reveals to her that her mother eventually had a romantic relationship with the Comedian, despite his previous attempted rape of her. Blake is revealed to be her biological father, and she is distraught, saying "My life is just one big joke." She smashes Manhattan\'s watch-like machine; Manhattan generates a protective field around them both, sheltering them from the debris. Manhattan tells her that he was wrong about undervaluing miracles. He notes that against "unfathomable odds" Laurie came from the coupling of Sally and the Comedian, "a miracle". The view pulls back from Mars, revealing that they are standing in a giant smiley face on the planet\'s surface.\n\nRorschach and Nite Owl fly south to Karnac (in Antarctica) where Archie, having been underwater in New York for many hours, freezes from the water still in it & is suddenly rendered unpilotable, crash lands. Jimi Hendrix\'s "All Along the Watchtower" plays as Ozymandias watches Rorschach and Nite Owl hiking in the snow towards Karnac on one of dozens of televisions that are arrayed before him. Other televisions display newscasts and other information from around the globe. Rorschach and Nite Owl sneak in, thinking that he is unaware of their arrival. In fact, he is fully aware.\n\nThey confront Ozymandias, attempting to subdue him in hand-to-hand combat, however, he easily defeats them both. Veidt confirms he is the mastermind behind the Comedian\'s murder, because he was "cracking badly" and had uncovered Ozymandias\' plan. He also spent $2 billion to manipulate Manhattan into not seeing the future and leaving the Earth, arranged the framing of Rorschach, and also staged his own assassination attempt to place himself above suspicion.\n\nHe explains that his plan is to unify the United States and Soviet Union and prevent nuclear war by "killing millions" in several of the world\'s largest cities, "to save billions." Veidt intends to use devices with Dr. Manhattan\'s unique energy signature to destroy the cities. The world will think Dr. Manhattan is behind all the deaths and will unite against him, thereby stopping the impending nuclear war. Rorschach and Nite Owl attempt to stop him, but Ozymandias tells them that he would only tell them his plan if they couldn\'t possibly prevent it. In fact, he had started the destruction 35 minutes earlier. On TV monitors, they see that the cities are being destroyed. Henry Kissinger tells Nixon that the energy signatures are not nuclear devices launched from the Soviet Union, they are from Dr. Manhattan.\n\nLaurie and Manhattan arrive at the ruins of New York City and see the results of Ozymandias\'s plan. Manhattan observes that the destruction was "made to look like I did it." They teleport to Karnak to confront Ozymandias. Ozymandias appears to obliterate Manhattan, and Laurie pulls out a gun and shoots him. He falls down the stairs, but then realizes that he caught the bullet and is completely unharmed.\n\nIn a first surprise for Ozymandias, Manhattan reappears, telling Veidt that he was able to more easily and quickly reassemble himself, having learned how to do so from the first accident that claimed his life. "The world\'s smartest man poses no more threat to me than does its smartest termite."\n\nOzymandias reveals a TV remote control, and all of the televisions are switched to a broadcast of Nixon blaming Manhattan for the destruction. After President Nixon states that the US and Soviets have allied, Dr. Manhattan realizes Ozymandias\' plan is logical and revealing the conspiracy would only break the peace and lead again to nuclear destruction.\n\nRorschach is unwilling to remain silent and angrily turns to leave, steadfastly believing that a crime has been committed and that the world must know about it.\n\nManhattan says that he understands, "without condoning or condemning", how Adrian feels about killing millions of innocents to save the planet. Outside Rorschach is confronted by Manhattan. In despair, Rorschach takes off his mask, and he demands that Manhattan kill him; Manhattan finally obliges, leaving only a bloody outline in the snow. Daniel is a witness and cries out in anguish.\n\nManhattan shares a final kiss with Laurie and departs for another galaxy that is "a little less complicated. Maybe I\'ll create some life there".\n\nAfter watching Manhattan kill Rorschach, Daniel comes back into the building and attacks Adrian, telling him that he has "deformed" mankind. Adrian takes the blows without emotion. Daniel and Laurie fly away in Archie.\n\nWe hear the beginning of an episode of The Outer Limits as Laurie talks with her mother. She tells her mother that she knows the Comedian was her father, and they make amends. Daniel appears and says that Archie is all updated and ready.\n\nDaniel observes that "As long as people think that Jon is still watching, we\'ll be okay."\n\nOutside, life goes on.\n\nA newspaper editor in New York complains of nothing worthwhile to print because of the world-wide peace. He tells a young reporter, Seymour, that it\'s like living in a world-wide hippie commune where the only hamburgers available have a Russian variation: borscht. The reporter says that they could write a story about Ronald Reagan who may run for president. The editor dismisses this; "Americans don\'t want a cowboy in the White House." Instead, he tells Seymour he should print whatever he likes from a collection of crank mailings. The camera focuses on the mail basket containing Rorschach\'s journal.']

['In the 21st century, sexual intercourse and reproduction are prohibited, whereas use of mind-altering drugs is mandatory to enforce compliance among the citizens and to ensure their ability to conduct dangerous and demanding tasks. Emotions, coitus, and the concept of family are taboo. Everyone is clad in identical uniforms and has shaven heads to emphasize equality, except the police androids (who wear black) and robed monks. Instead of names, people have designations with three arbitrary letters (referred to as the "prefix") and four digits, shown on an identity badge worn at all times.\n\nAt their jobs in central video control centers, SEN 5241 and LUH 3417 keep surveillance on the city. LUH has a male roommate, THX 1138, who works in a factory producing android police officers. At the beginning of the story, THX leaves the job while the loudspeakers urge the workers to "increase safety" - and congratulate them for only losing 195 workers in the last period - to the competing factory\'s 242. On the way home, he stops at a confession booth in a row of many, and mumbles prayers about "party" and "masses", under the portrait of "OMM 0000". A soothing voice greets THX, and OMM ends every confession with a parting salutation: "You are a true believer, blessings of the State, blessings of the masses. Work hard, increase production, prevent accidents and be happy".\n\nAt home, THX takes his drugs and watches holobroadcasts while engaging with a masturbatory device. LUH secretly substitutes pills in her possession for THX\'s medications, whereupon THX eventually suffers physical discomfort (vomiting) along with mental/emotional changes (confusion). The drug substitution also leads to LUH and THX becoming involved romantically, resulting in the two engaging in intercourse. THX later is confronted by SEN, who arranges THX as his new roommate, but THX files a complaint against SEN for the illegal housing mate change. Without drugs in his system, THX falters during a critical and hazardous phase of his job, and a control center engages a "mind lock" on THX which raises the level of danger. After the release of the mind lock, THX makes the necessary correction to that work phase. THX and LUH are arrested. THX enjoys a brief reunion with LUH, disrupted shortly after she reveals her pregnancy.\n\nAt THX\'s trial, THX is sentenced to prison, alongside SEN. Most of the prisoners seem uninterested in escape, but eventually THX and SEN find an exit and they are later joined by hologram SRT 5752, who starred in the holobroadcasts. During the escape, THX and SRT are separated from SEN. Chased by the police robots, THX and SRT are trapped in a control center, from which THX learns that LUH has been "consumed", and her name has been reassigned to fetus 66691 in a growth chamber. SEN eventually escapes to an area reserved for the monks of OMM, where a lone monk notices that SEN has no identification badge. SEN attacks him and later wanders into a child-rearing area, strikes up a conversation with children, and sits aimlessly until police androids apprehend him. THX and SRT steal two cars, but SRT crashes his into a concrete pillar.\n\nPursued by two police androids on motorcycles, THX flees to the limits of the city and escapes into a ventilation shaft. The police androids pursue him on motorcycles along the ventilation shaft to an escape ladder, but are ordered by Central Command to cease pursuit, on grounds that the expense of his capture exceeds their budget by 6%. The city is then revealed to be entirely underground, and THX has escaped onto the surface, where he then witnesses the sun setting.']

['In the town of Bunnyburrow, 9 year old bunny, Judy Hopps (\n\nDella Saba\n\n) is performing in a school play. Her theme explains that animals, once primitive and wild, have now evolved to where predators and prey can live side by side in harmony. The founding mammal city, Zootopia, is hailed as a place where anyone can be anything. Judy then announces that she wants to be a police officer. A kid fox in the audience, Gideon Grey (\n\nPhil Johnston\n\n), sneers at the idea and even Judy\'s parents, Bonnie and Stu (\n\nBonnie Hunt\n\n and \n\nDon Lake\n\n) tell her that there\'s never been a bunny officer. However, Judy is willing to try against all odds. When Judy sees Gideon bullying some kids by taking their fair tickets she boldly confronts him, but Gideon responds by taunting Judy\'s dreams and slashing her in the face. He leaves and, though she\'s hurt, Judy shows her friends the tickets she got back and declares that she doesn\'t know when to quit.\n\nYears later Judy attends the Zootopia Police Academy. Judy is tiny compared to the other recruits and faces difficulties managing the obstacle courses run by the drill sergeant (\n\nFuschia!\n\n). But through sheer determination, and by using her wits, Judy makes it to graduation as valedictorian. Zootopia Mayor Lionheart (\n\nJ.K. Simmons\n\n) oversees the ceremony and Assistant Mayor Bellwether (\n\nJenny Slate\n\n), a sheep, formally congratulates Judy as the first bunny police officer, saying it\'s a big day for all small animals. She is assigned to Precinct 1 in the heart of Zootopia, much to the apprehension of her parents.\n\nA few days after, Judy, her parents, and many siblings head to the train station. Stu convinces Judy to take a can of fox repellent with her before she gets on the train to Zootopia. Judy listens to a hit by pop singer, Gazelle (\n\nShakira\n\n), as she zooms through the diverse districts of the city, from the frozen tundra to the sultry rainforest. She finds her apartment, a run-down single room with a rickety bed, paper-thin walls, and two noisy neighbors, Bucky and Pronk Oryx-Antlerson (\n\nByron Howard\n\n and \n\nJared Bush\n\n). Despite this, she\'s all to excited for her first day. She gets up bright and early and makes it to the police station where she is directed to role call by the pudgy desk sergeant, a cheetah named Benjamin Clawhauser (\n\nNate Torrence\n\n). All the other officers (elephants, rhinos, hippos, and bears) tower over Judy. Police Chief Bogo (\n\nIdris Elba\n\n) calls them to order and explains their first priority is handling the case of fourteen missing animals; all predators. Bogo divides everyone into teams but assigns Judy to parking duty.\n\nJudy is disappointed but sets her standards high and uses her sharp ears to help her write 200 tickets before noon. Around then, she notices a fox who appears to be up to something enter a local ice cream shop run by Jerry Jumbeaux Jr. (\n\nJohn DiMaggio\n\n). Though suspicious at first, Judy then sees the fox, Nick Wilde (\n\nJason Bateman\n\n), is just trying to purchase a jumbo-pop for his son who is wearing an elephant costume. Jerry refuses service to the fox with sneering bigotry and this angers Judy who steps in and proposes a compromise; she\'ll let the elephants off with a warning for the health code violation of serving ice cream without gloves on their trunks if Nick can have a jumbo-pop. When Nick confesses he doesn\'t have his wallet, and apologizes to his son for the worst birthday, Judy goes further and pays for the treat. She tells Nick she can\'t stand it when people are mistreated for being predators or prey and walks away with a spring in her step, happy to have helped someone in need.\n\nLater that day, Judy is writing more tickets when she notices the little fox in his elephant suit. She approaches to say hello but then notices that he and Nick are melting the jumbo-pop from the roof of a building and letting the drippings collect in large jars. They drive away together, with the little fox at the wheel. Judy follows them into Tundratown and sees them making mini pops with the melted juice. They take them into the Savannah District and sell them to hamsters coming out of work. The hamsters chomp on the pops and leave the sticks in a recycling bin. The little fox collects the sticks and he and Nick take them to a construction zone in Little Rodentia where they\'re sold as lumber. Later, Nick and his \'son\', a full-grown fennec fox named Finnick (\n\nTom Lister Jr.\n\n), part ways and Judy confronts Nick. Nick doesn\'t deny that he\'s a hustler but provides Judy with all the paperwork he needs to make his endeavors technically legal and humbles her by saying that the city is not a magical land where dreams come true and a meter maid can never be a real cop.\n\nJudy returns to her apartment, sullen, and bears through an inadvertently insulting call from her parents who are thoughtlessly relieved to see she is not a "real cop" in their eyes and has instead the safest job on the force. The next day, Judy is writing more tickets and enduring unending verbal abuse from the citizenry for her duty when she is approached by a frantic pig (\n\nJosh Dallas\n\n) who tells her he\'s just been robbed. Judy springs into action and chases the thieving weasel (\n\nAlan Tudyk\n\n) through the city square and into Little Rodentia. During the chase, in which Judy has to take considerable pains to avoid accidental harm to the tiny citizenry and their property, Duke kicks a plastic doughnut from a shop toward Judy and it nearly crushes a lady shrew, but Judy stops it in the nick of time and uses the doughnut to apprehend the weasel. Judy rolls him into the station but is called to Bogo\'s office. He reprimands her for leaving her post and endangering the public to retrieve a bag of moldy onions. Judy objects, saying that the \'onions\' are actually flower bulbs called Midnicampum holicithias and that she only wanted to serve as a real cop. However, Chief Bogo responds that she had her orders as a parking attendant and disobeyed them, making a political appointee like her intolerable to him.\n\nJust then, an otter named Mrs. Otterton (\n\nOctavia Spencer\n\n) barges in, begging Chief Bogo to find her husband, Emmitt, who has been missing for ten days. Bogo offers empty assurances until Judy steps up and promises to find him. Bogo escorts Mrs. Otterton out of the office before firing Judy for insubordination. However, when he opens the door again, he finds Mrs. Otterton speaking with Assistant Mayor Bellwether who promptly sends a notice to the mayor about Judy\'s willingness to take the case and tells Judy to come to her for any assistance. Bogo reluctantly allows Judy to take the case but gives her a 48 hour ultimatum; she finds the otter or resigns. Judy agrees.\n\nAt the front desk, Clawhauser gives Judy the case file but there are no leads or witnesses and, since she\'s new, she has no technological resources. However, Judy notices in the lone photograph they have that Emmitt is eating a familiar looking popsicle. She locates Nick on the streets and demands his help but he refuses. When she says his ten dollars\' worth of mini pops can wait, he claims to have made two hundred a day since he was twelve. Judy records Nick on her carrot pen recorder and puts his own words against his tax files which show he\'s claimed zero income. Judy says she\'ll report him for tax evasion, a federal offense, unless he helps her. Finnick, who was asleep in the stroller Nick was pushing, laughs at the reverse hustle and wishes Nick good luck working with the fuzz before walking off.\n\nNick takes Judy to Mystic Springs Oasis, the last place he saw Otterton going. They\'re met by a yak named Yax (\n\nTommy Chong\n\n), doing yoga behind a desk. He recognizes Mr. Otterton but says he hasn\'t seen him in a couple of weeks. He then takes them into the oasis to find Emmitt\'s yoga instructor, an elephant named Nangi (\n\nGita Reddy\n\n), and Judy is shocked to find the oasis is a haven for naturalists; nude animals. Nangi has no memory of Otterton, but Yax unwittingly gives Judy all the information she needs, including the plate number for the car Otterton was picked up in the last time he was there. Nick says he has a friend at the DMV who can help them run the plate number. There, Judy is disheartened to see that the DMV is run solely by sloths. Nick\'s friend, Flash (\n\nRaymond S. Persi\n\n) is able to run the plate number for them but, naturally, takes forever to do so. This isn\'t helped when Nick, in an attempt to push Judy\'s buttons, delays them with a joke. By the time they exit, it\'s nighttime.\n\nJudy finds out the car in question is a limo in Tundratown but, by the time she and Nick arrive, the lot\'s closed. Without a warrant, Judy cannot get in. Defeated, she holds out her recording pen to Nick but flings it over the fence. Nick goes to retrieve it and Judy meets him on the other side, slyly saying that she doesn\'t need a warrant if she has probable cause - and a shifty-looking fox climbing over the gate qualifies. They locate the limo and search it, finding polar bear fur, claw marks all over the back seat, and Otterton\'s wallet. Then, Nick recognizes an insignia on a drinking glass and panics; he knows who\'s car this is. When they open the car door to leave they\'re confronted by a couple of polar bears who shove them into a car.\n\nSqueezed in the back seat between two polar bears, Nick explains that the car belongs to a thug boss named Mr. Big with whom he\'s not on good terms because Nick sold him an expensive rug made from the fur of a skunk\'s butt. Nick and Judy are brought into a study where Mr. Big (\n\nMaurice LaMarche\n\n), a shrew, is carried in by his polar bear guards. He berates Nick for tarnishing his trust and the hospitality of his grandmother who he recently buried in the skunk rug, and scolds him for returning on the day of his daughter\'s wedding. Unafraid, Judy steps forward and tells Mr. Big that she knows Emmitt Otterton was with him last and will find out what happened to him if it\'s the last thing she does. Unfazed, Mr. Big orders his bears to \'ice\' Nick and Judy and they\'re held over a trap door in the floor that reveals icy water. Mr. Big\'s daughter, Fru Fru (\n\nLeah Latham\n\n), then walks in wearing her wedding dress and recognizes Judy as the bunny that saved her the previous day from being crushed by the doughnut. In gratitude, Mr. Big releases Judy and Nick and invites them to Fru Fru\'s wedding reception where he explains that Otterton was his florist but, before meeting with him to discuss something important, went crazy in the limo he sent, attacked his driver, and disappeared. Mr. Big directs them to speak with the driver, Manchas (\n\nJesse Corti\n\n), in the Rainforest District for more information.\n\nManchas, a melanistic jaguar, cracks open the door when Nick and Judy arrive, showing scratches all over his face and acting fearful. He tells them that Otterton kept talking about the \'night howlers\' before he went wild and savagely attacked him. Nick says they\'re there to talk about the night howlers too and Manchas agrees to let them in but, just after he unlocks the chain, Judy and Nick hear him groan followed by a thud. They push the door open to see Manchas on all fours, growling viciously at them. Nick and Judy run for their lives, pursued closely by Manchas. Judy manages to call for backup as she and Nick tumble and fall through the slick canopy. Finally, Judy is able to cuff Manchas to a light pole near a gondola station and throws herself and Nick off it into some vines away from the jaguar\'s claws. They meet up with the responding police units and Judy explains to Chief Bogo that she believes Manchas, like Otterton, went \'savage\'. However, when she takes them back to the gondola station, Manchas is gone. Bogo, irritated and not believing Judy\'s story demands her to hand over her badge for failing to complete her assignment, but Nick stands up for Judy. He says that Bogo gave them 48 hours, which means they have ten left to find Otterton. He takes Judy onto a gondola and they leave.\n\nOver the rainforest, Nick explains that he was idealistic like Judy once. As a kid, he wanted nothing more than to join the Junior Ranger Scouts. His mother bought him a new uniform and he was excited to become part of the group, despite the fact that he was the only predator to join. Upon arriving, however, the other animals bullied and muzzled him, saying that he was stupid for thinking they\'d trust a fox. After that day he decided he would never let anyone see that they had gotten to him and if people only thought of foxes as shifty and untrustworthy, then that\'s what he would be. Judy consoles him but Nick deflects from her affections by looking at traffic below. He then realizes that there are traffic cameras all over the canopy and they can use them to find out where Manchas was taken.\n\nJudy recalls that Assistant Mayor Bellwether offered to help them. They meet her at City Hall and she takes them to her office which is nothing more than a janitor\'s closet. Despite her upbeat personality, it\'s no secret that she\'s woefully mistreated by the Mayor. She opens the database for the Rainforest District traffic cameras before being called away by Lionheart. Judy and Nick find the footage of Manchas and see that he was netted and hauled away by timber wolves. Judy realizes that the wolves must be the Night Howlers. They watch as the wolves\' van drives through a tunnel but fails to come out the other side. Nick says that there\'s a maintenance tunnel and, if he were to do anything illegal, that\'s the route he\'d take to avoid observation. They relocate the van and go to where it was headed - an old building outside of town called Cliffside Asylum. Nick and Judy make it past the guards by inciting a group howl; something the wolves can\'t resist. Inside, they find new equipment in an old hospital ward. Following claw marks on the floor, they find fifteen cells inhabited by various predators, all feral and savage, including Manchas and Mr. Otterton.\n\nJudy realizes she\'s just found all of the missing mammals but, just then, Mayor Lionheart enters with a badger doctor (\n\nKatie Lowes\n\n). Judy and Nick hide in an empty cell and Judy records Lionheart as he demands to know why predators are going savage. The doctor has no answer and says that they must come forward to Chief Bogo but the Mayor refuses, saying his reputation as a predator official is at stake. At that moment, Judy\'s phone rings with a call from her parents. Lionheart is startled and the doctor orders security to investigate before locking off the wing. Nick and Judy escape by flushing themselves down a toilet just before the guards arrive and they manage to get the evidence Judy recorded back to Bogo.\n\nThe ZPD arrive at the asylum and place everyone, including the Mayor, under arrest. Lionheart protests that they still don\'t know why predators are going savage and he was trying to protect the public. Later, Chief Bogo, deeply impressed at Hopp\'s achievement, holds a press conference where Judy gives Nick her pen recorder and offers him the chance to sign up as her partner. Nick is flattered and watches as Judy is called to the stand to answer some questions. Judy starts simple, mentioning that all the savage mammals are predators, but when pressed as to why, she speculates that it could be something to do with their DNA. As predators, the inflicted may have reverted back to their primal origins. The reporters go into a frenzy before Bellwether shuts down the conference. Judy is relieved to be off the podium but Nick is angered by what she said. Judy says she was just stating facts but Nick asks her if a fox such as himself should indeed be trusted. When he raises his arms, asking if Judy is afraid of him, she instinctively puts her hand on her fox repellent. He hands her back the application, telling her that it\'s best she doesn\'t have a predator for a partner, before leaving.\n\nA wedge is driven between the predator and prey populations, with prey acting fearful against all predators. Gazelle hosts a peaceful protest against discrimination, despite backlash, and savage attacks continue in the city as more predators go primal. Judy feels responsible for the ensuing tensions between the animals and goes to see Mrs. Otterton where she\'s watching Emmitt meander mindlessly in his hospital room. At the police station, Judy is summoned by Bogo to see the new mayor, Bellwether. Bellwether explains that with the population in Zootopia being 90% prey, she wants Judy as the face of the ZPD to inspire hope. But Judy claims that she\'s no hero and says she\'s done the opposite of what she wanted; to make the world a better place. She says a good cop should help the city, not tear it apart, and hands over her badge before leaving.\n\nJudy returns to Bunnyburrow where she manages her parent\'s vegetable stand. She wonders aloud to them how she ever thought she could make a difference but they console her as a pie truck pulls up. As the driver, a grown Gideon Grey, gets out, Judy\'s parents explain that they\'ve partnered up with him and never would have done so had Judy not opened their eyes. Gideon apologizes to Judy for what he did when he was younger, stating that his own insecurities manifested into unchecked rage, but Judy forgives him and says she knows a thing or two about being a jerk. Just then, some bunny children run through the field behind them and Judy\'s father warns them to stay away from the growing Midnicampum holicithias near the edge. Gideon laughs and says his family just called them night howlers. Judy perks up at this and her father explains that the flowers keep away pests but are toxic. His brother Terry ate one and went into a rage, biting Judy\'s mother. Judy realizes that the night howlers weren\'t the wolves - they were flowers. Not only that, but they make animals go savage.\n\nShe grabs the keys to the truck and races back to Zootopia. She finds Finnick and he points her to Nick, sitting in the sun beside a small bridge. Judy runs up to him and reveals the truth about the night howlers but he walks away. Desperate, Judy apologizes to him and says she needs his help. She begins to cry and admits that she was a jerk to him and really is a dumb bunny as he once said. Nick doesn\'t seem to react until he replays a recording of her repentance and holds up her pen recorder enabling that and smiles, saying he\'ll erase it after 48 hours, before embracing a profoundly relieved Judy. They climb into the truck and Nick helps himself to some of Judy\'s blueberries while she shows him a picture of the weasel thief she caught stealing the Midnicampum holicithias; Duke Weaselton. They find him on a street corner selling bootleg DVDs such as \'Wrangled\', \'Pig Hero 6\', and \'Meowana\'. Judy confronts him and demands to know what he was doing with the night howler flower bulbs, but he says he won\'t talk. Judy and Nick smile slyly and take the weasel to Mr. Big. Duke is incredulous as to why Mr. Big would help a cop, but Mr. Big smiles and says Judy is the godmother of his future grandchild. A very pregnant Fru Fru says she\'s going to name her daughter after Judy. On threat of being iced, Duke relents and confesses he sold bulbs to a ram named Doug who works out of an abandoned rail station.\n\nNick and Judy follow the directions to a rusty subway car underground. They sneak inside and find Doug (\n\nRich Moore\n\n) in a yellow jumpsuit preparing the blue flowers and harvesting them chemically to produce a serum which he puts into fragile pellets. He loads a pellet into a gun as his phone rings, telling him his next mark is a cheetah in Sahara Square. He assures the caller he can make the hit since he was able to get an otter in a moving car. He places the gun in a briefcase and goes to answer a knock at the back of the car, saying that Woolter and Jesse have come back with coffee. Judy takes the opportunity to knock Doug out of the car and locks the door before ordering Nick to get the car moving. With some finagling, they\'re able to start it and the car moves down the track, slowly gaining speed. Judy is intent on bringing the evidence to police headquarters but two rams jump onto the moving car. They manage to knock Jesse off the car inside the tunnel, grazing him as he hugs the wall and shaving his belly pink. Woolter head-butts his way into the front of the car as they make their way outside but they soon face another oncoming train. Judy tells Nick to speed up and kicks Woolter into a switch lever just in time, but they are traveling too fast around the next curve and the car derails into the next empty station. Judy and Nick jump from the car as the friction causes it to go up in flames and watch from the platform as it explodes. Judy thinks all the evidence is destroyed but Nick holds up the briefcase with the gun inside.\n\nThey run upstairs out of the station and into the Natural History Museum, empty due to renovations. As they near the exit toward the police station they are called from behind by Mayor Bellwether, accompanied by two rams in police uniform. Bellwether thanks Judy for discovering the perpetrators behind the predator conspiracy and reaches for the briefcase but Judy wonders aloud how she knew where to find them. They edge toward the exit but are blocked by a disheveled Woolter. Realizing Bellwether was behind the plot all along, Judy and Nick run and attempt to hide down a corridor. Along the way Judy runs into a protruding mammoth tusk and cuts her leg. Nick pulls a handkerchief out of his pocket, blueberries spilling everywhere, and bandages Judy\'s leg but she tells him to leave her since she can\'t walk. They try to think of something as they are surrounded by the sheep.\n\nBellwether calls out to Judy, saying that in the city prey outnumber predators 10 to 1. They need to band together to end their mistreatment against the more powerful and loud predators and, once united, will be unstoppable. Judy and Nick run for it but are knocked into a sunken diorama and Nick drops the briefcase. Bellwether retrieves it and looks down on Nick and Judy before taking aim with the gun and shooting Nick. The blue solution covers his neck and he trembles while Bellwether calls the police and feigns alarm, saying Officer Judy is down and being attacked by a savage fox. Judy tells Bellwether her plan won\'t work as Nick advances on her, growling. Bellwether says that fear always works and, with a predisposition to savagery, predators will be forced out of Zootopia and she\'ll dart every one to keep it that way.\n\nNick then lunges at Judy and puts his jaws around her neck, but just as quickly releases her as Judy puts on a dramatic performance. Nick and Judy then reveal they switched out the serum in the gun with blueberries and have recorded everything Bellwether said on Judy\'s pen recorder. Horrified, Bellwether backs up to flee only to be stopped and arrested by the responding ZPD.\n\nOn the news, an anchor reads that Bellwether was charged for masterminding the savage predator conspiracy. Former Mayor Lionheart gives an interview where he says he didn\'t know about Bellwether\'s plot and only caged the savage predators to protect the city, citing he did a wrong thing for the right reasons. It is announced that an antidote has been created with positive effects. Judy goes to the hospital where she sees Emmitt Otterton recovering and embracing his concerned wife.\n\nMonths later, Judy, a police officer again and much wizened by her experience, addresses the new police academy graduates, one of them being Nick Wilde. She says, "When I was a kid, I thought Zootopia was this perfect place where everyone got along and anyone could be anything. Turns out, real life\'s a little bit more complicated than a slogan on a bumper sticker. Real life is messy. We all have limitations. We all make mistakes, which means...hey, glass half full! We all have a lot in common. And the more we try to understand one another, the more exceptional each of us will be. But we have to try. No matter what type of animal you are, from the biggest elephant to our first fox, I implore you: Try. Try to make a difference. Try to make the world a better place. Try to look inside yourself and recognize that change starts with you. It starts with me. It starts with all of us."\n\nNick approaches the stage and Judy pins on his cop badge. The next day, Chief Bogo hands out assignments, giving Nick and Judy the task of catching a hot-rodder tearing up the roads downtown. Judy and Nick come across the speeder in their patrol car and pull him over, surprised to see Flash the sloth behind the wheel. Flash smiles slyly at Nick and the credits roll as Gazelle (Shakira) performs \'Try Everything\' at a concert in Zootopia with everyone in attendance save for Bellwether who watches the show on TV from prison.']
['Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a construction worker in the distant future. He is happily married to Lori (Sharon Stone), but is dissatisfied with his place in life. She teases him about a recurring nightmare about being on Mars with a beautiful woman who is not his wife. On the way to work he sees an advertisement on the subway TV for Rekall, Inc., a facility that implants fake memories of ideal vacations. Against the advice of his co-worker Harry (Robert Costanzo), Doug visits Rekall and orders a special package that will implant memories of an adventure trip on Mars as a secret agent. Before the procedure begins, he is asked to select a woman of his choice. He chooses a brunette, with an athletic body, and a sleazy and demure personality.\n\nBefore the memory implantation procedure can begin, Quaid goes into a violent rage, ranting about his cover being blown and how men are coming to kill him. He tries to break free of his restraints, and the Rekall director tries to calm Quaid. Quaid responds by throttling him and muttering, "My name is not Quaid!" The technicians tranquilize him and he falls unconscious. The Rekall director believes that Doug was acting out the secret agent part of the trip, but learns that the memories have not yet been implanted. The technicians realize that Doug\'s memory had previously been erased. To cover their involvement, the Rekall director orders his team to erase his memories of Rekall, refund his credits, and send him home.\n\nQuaid awakens in a Johnny Cab (with a robotic driver) that takes him to a subway station where he can catch a train home. While walking through the subway, he is attacked and detained by several men led by Harry, his co-worker. They accuse him of blabbing about Mars while he was at Rekall, although because Rekall erased his memory, Quaid cannot remember anything about Rekall or being on Mars. Harry prepares to shoot Quaid, but Quaid fights back, successfully killing Harry and all of his men. He doesn\'t understand where he obtained his newfound hand-to-hand skills and is horrified at his actions.\n\nQuaid rushes back home to Lori and tells her what happened. She recognizes that he\'s regained his memory of Mars and attacks him. They fight and Doug subdues and interrogates her. Holding a gun that he took from her to her head, Quaid pressures Lori into revealing that his original identity has been erased and a new one implanted, which included her as his wife so she could watch over him for past six weeks. An astonished Quaid asks, "If I\'m not me, who the hell am I?"\n\nA video monitor in Quaid\'s apartment displays the arrival of several men with weapons outside their apartment building. Quaid knocks Lori out and flees. He is pursued by Lori\'s real husband Richter (Michael Ironside), an agent of a mysterious Agency led by Vilos Cohaagen (Ronny Cox), the corporate dictator of Mars. Richter is intent on killing Quaid who he apparently knew on Mars. Lori greets Richter as her real-life husband. Richter and his men try to kill Quaid as they chase him through the streets and into an underground subway station. As Quaid escapes he kills some of Richter\'s men. Cohaagen contacts Richter and asks about the gunfight. Richter explains that he is "trying to neutralize a traitor." Cohaagen angrily orders Richter not to kill Quaid because they still need him. He tells Richter that Quaid must be captured alive for re-implantation. Richter, intent on killing Quaid, pretends he has a bad connection and hangs up. Richter\'s right-hand man, Helm, tells Richter they\'ve located Quaid using a tracking device.\n\nDoug finds a room in a cheap, anonymous hotel, but a mysterious man calls him in his room and tells him he as a suitcase for him. Quaid, puzzled, asks who he is. The man says they were agents together on Mars. He tells Quaid that there is a bug inside his head that allows Richter to track him. Following the man\'s instructions, Quaid wraps his head in a wet towel to disrupt the tracking signal. He gets the suitcase and as he is leaving the hotel Richter and Helm arrive. They chase Quaid in another Johnny Cab taxi who escapes their violent pursuit and flees to an abandoned factory. Though Quaid is still wearing the towel on his head, they\'re able to track a faint signal.\n\nWhen Quaid opens the case a screen plays a recording of himself. He finds a variety of spy gear inside the suitcase. The recording tells Quaid he was originally Hauser, a high-ranking member of the "Agency" and Cohaagen\'s key agent. In the recording, Hauser tells Quaid that he met Melina (Rachel Ticotin), an agent for rebels on Mars, and that she convinced him to switch sides. Hauser says that Cohaagen discovered his treason, the Agency erased his identity and a new one implanted. In the new identity, Quaid was exiled to Earth where he could be closely watched. Hauser tells Quaid how to remove the tracking device from his skull. After Quaid successfully (and painfully) extracts the bug, Hauser tells him to go to Mars and connect with the rebels to help destroy Cohaagen\'s empire. Quaid stuffs the bug inside a candy bar and throws it to some nearby rats and flees, leaving Richter, Helm & their men to chase the bug around the factory.\n\nQuaid arrives on Mars at a giant domed mining colony half-buried in the martian landscape. Many of the people living on Mars are deformed and possess psychic abilities caused by the mixture of solar radiation and shoddy air quality provided by Cohaagen. Cohaagen\'s men follow Quaid to Mars. They see some recent graffiti proclaiming that the mysterious mutant leader "Kuato" is still a threat. They zero Quaid when the disguise he\'s wearing, a lifelike mask of a large woman, fails and he\'s exposed. They open fire and crack one of the shielding windows, causing a sudden decompression in the room. One of the customs agents is able to hit an emergency button and the rush of air stops. Quaid escapes.\n\nOne a train from the customs station, Quaid sees the giant mountain housing the Pyramid Mine, which supplies an enormous amount of turbinium, an ore vital to a major war back on Earth, in the distance and asks another passenger about it. The passenger tells Quaid he worked there until they found alien artifacts there & shut the mine down. Quaid suggests it\'s just a rumor but the other man scoffs at the idea.\n\nRichter meets with Cohaagen and receives a furious chewing out over his reckless behavior while trying to kill Quaid. He also tells Richter that he deliberately has kept vital information from him so they can capture Quaid alive and finally find Kuato and kill him.\n\nQuaid gets a suite at the Hilton and retrieves a note from a hotel safe that he left for himself. It tells him to contact Melina at The Last Resort. Outside the hotel, a mutant taxi driver named Benny (Mel Johnson Jr.), persuades Quaid to let him take him to Venusville and The Last Resort, a bar and brothel. Quaid finds Melina, who strongly resembles the woman he requested at Rekall, but he can\'t remember her and she doesn\'t believe his story. She orders him to leave at gunpoint.\n\nQuaid returns to the Hilton and is visited by Dr. Edgemar (Roy Brocksmith), the founder of Rekall, whom Quaid saw in a Rekall ad on Earth. Edgemar tells Quaid that everything that has happened since his trip to Rekall is all in his mind and that he\'s actually back at Rekall, still strapped into the chair in the lab. He says everything Quaid has experienced since falling unconscious at Rekall on planet Earth has been a dream due to a "schizoid embolism" and "acute neurological trauma". Quaid, disbelieving, holds him at gunpoint. Edgemar tells Quaid his entire experience matches the dreams he asked to be implanted.\n\nTo prove his point, Edgemar opens the hotel door and Lori enters. She pleads with Quaid to listen to Dr. Edgemar. Edgemar offers Doug a pill, "a symbol of his desire to return to reality." He says Quaid must take the pill voluntarily to escape his permanent dream state. If he does, he will fall asleep and then wake up at the memory implant facility on Earth. He tells Quaid that if he doesn\'t take the pill, he will end up lobotomized and his mind will be trapped in this alternate reality forever. Quaid seriously considers the offer, but before he can swallow the pill, he spots a drop of sweat on the nervous Dr. Edgemar\'s face. He thinks this confirms that he is experiencing reality and not a dream and immediately shoots and kills Edgemar. A team of men break suddenly break through the room\'s walls and capture Quaid. Lori deals him several painful blows, the last one knocking him unconscious.\n\nLori and Richter\'s men take the subdued and shackled Quaid to an elevator. When the elevator doors open, Melina opens fire with a sub-machine gun, killing all but Lori. Melina and Lori fight, but just as Lori is about to stab Melina with a knife, Quaid shoots the knife out of her hand. She looks up, telling he wouldn\'t hurt her because they\'re married. Seeing her reaching for a gun, Quaid shoots her dead, replying, "Consider that a divorce."\n\nRichter and Helm burst out of the elevator. Richter sees Lori\'s dead body and marches after Quaid and Melina. Helm stops Richter when he tries to shoot at Quaid while he stands in front of a protective dome pane. They flee the hotel where Benny is conveniently waiting for them. He takes them to Venusville and The Last Resort. They hide behind a secret panel. The rebels and Cohaagen\'s security forces engage in a firefight during which Helm and several of Richter\'s security forces are killed. Richter barely escapes and takes command of a platoon of reinforcements. Cohaagen calls Richter after hearing about the firefight and orders him to pull back. Richter and his men retreat and the entire neighborhood is sealed off and the oxygen circulation system and fans feeding the area fresh air are turned off.\n\nQuaid is taken by the rebels to meet Kuato, the mysterious leader of the rebellion. Kuato is psychic and can spot undercover Martian agents and extract information from them. They hope that Kuato can read Quaid\'s mind and find key information that will help them defeat Cohaagen and free Mars from his dictatorship. They take Quaid to see George (Marshall Bell), a high ranking rebel officer, before he can meet Kuato. They meet George in a private room, who opens his shirt to reveal that he is also Kuato, a conjoined, symbiotic creature with only a small head and arms. Kuato reads Quaid\'s mind and sees a vision of alien ruins, that have been rumored to lie underneath Mars. Cohaagen has kept their existence secret because it would convert the turbinium and make it worthless. The machine, if activated, would melt an underground glacier and release the oxygen, creating a breathable atmosphere for Mars.\n\nThe rebel hideout is attacked by Cohaagen\'s forces who massacre the rebels. Quaid, Melina, Benny and George/Kuato flee. As they prepare to escape, Benny suddenly shoots George/Kuato, revealing that he is a covert agent of Cohaagen. Before Kuato dies, he tells Quaid to start the reactor. Richter finishes Kuato off and takes Quaid and Melina to Cohaagen.\n\nIn his office, Cohaagen smugly explains to Quaid that the entire operation was a trap conceived by Hauser and Cohaagen. They devised a plan to trick Kuato by erasing Hauser\'s memory and implanting memories making him into Quaid so he could pass Kuato\'s psychic test. Quaid doesn\'t believe Cohaagen, but Cohaagen plays a recording made by Hauser before he became Quaid. Hauser, with Cohaagen at his side, congratulates Quaid for helping wipe out the rebels. Cohaagen orders that the oxygen supply to a large part of the Mars colony that aided the rebels be completely cut off.\n\nQuaid and Melina are taken to a memory implant facility so that Hauser\'s memories and personality can be restored. Melina will be implanted with memories making her subservient. During the memory programming procedure, Quaid escapes from his chair, frees Melina, and kills the tech workers and all the guards. The two head down to the alien ruins. Quaid explains to Melina that Kuato helped him remember that the ruins are actually reactors that will create enough air for the entire planet, and would thus cause Cohaagen to lose control of Mars.\n\nQuaid and Melina get to the ruins. They are attacked by Benny, who is driving a gigantic mining drilling machine. Quaid impales Benny with a power mining drill. They then find a way to the reactor, where a large platoon of soldiers, led by Richter, are waiting for them. Doug utilizes a hologram device to confuse the soldiers while he and Melina gun them all down. Richter boards a freight elevator that ascends to the ruins\' control panel. Quaid jumps on and the two fight, ending with Richter having his arms ripped off and falling to his death.\n\nQuaid makes it to the reactor control area, where Cohaagen is waiting for him; he has rigged the control facility to explode, and is just about to kill Quaid when he is shot and wounded by Melina. He activates the bomb, but Quaid throws it away before it detonates. The explosion rips a hole in the wall, causing depressurization. As Quaid and Melina hang on for dear life, Cohaagen is sucked into the atmosphere and lands in the Martian landscape, where he quickly dies from the lack of oxygen and the massive solar radiation. Quaid manages to turn the reactor on just before he and Melina are sucked into the atmosphere as well, but they are saved as the reactor releases a large amount of breathable air, which washes over the entire atmosphere. The rushing force of the new air smashes through all the protective windows of the colony. The people who were dying can now breathe freely again.\n\nAs Quaid and Melina gaze in astonishment at the Martian sky, which is now blue and clouded, Quaid wonders if he really is having a dream and if all of this is really happening in his head back on Earth at Rekall. Hearing this, Melina invites him to: "kiss me quick before you wake up." He and Melina kiss as the screen fades to white.']
['In the year 2154, the Earth is polluted, vastly overpopulated, the climate has become hot and dry and disease runs rampant through the dilapidated slums that the cities have become. The wealthiest people have fled the planet and taken refuge on Elysium, a Stanford Torus high-tech space station, just beyond earth\'s atmosphere.\n\nWhile those on Earth are policed by ruthless robots, Elysium\'s citizens are governed by President Patel (Faran Tahir), in a Utopian setting which includes access to private medical machines, called "Med-Bays," that offer instant cures for virtually any ailment or injury a person may experience.\n\nA young boy named Max DeCosta (Perry Cotton) and his young girlfriend, Frey Santiago (Valentina Giros), are living in the ruins of Los Angeles, where the surrounding area is now a vast desert and people live in nothing more than small shacks. Frey can read and she reads Max stories about Elysium. Max lives in an orphanage with a kindly nun. The nun says he is born to do something great.\n\nFrey and Max are looking up at Elysium, which is visible from Earth. Max intends to go there someday and promises to take Frey with him. Frey takes a pen and marks on Max\'s hand. She inscribes a circle and the letters M + F.\n\nYears later, when he\'s 36 years old, Max (Matt Damon), sports numerous tattoos and wears an electronic ankle bracelet. He is preparing to board a bus to travel to his job. Two security robots approach him as he\'s standing in line. When asked what he\'s carrying in his pack, Max answers with a sarcastic tone. They rip off his backpack, then hit him twice, breaking his wrist. He\'s a felon, a former car thief, and on parole, so he\'s frequently singled out for harassment. Max, identified as #6722, and Frey, now a nurse, accidentally meet at the clinic where he goes to have his arm treated. Max asks her to have coffee with him, but she declines. Finally, she agrees to meet him soon.\n\nMax had been ordered by the robots to go see his parole officer, another robot. The parole officer robot can detect "attitude" and it doesn\'t like Max\'s, so his parole is extended. The robot then offers Max a pill to help calm his heart rate, which it has detected as elevated. Max smirks and turns it down.\n\nMax works at an assembly line for Armadyne Corp, a company which supplies Elysian weaponry, as well as the robots which police the Earth. The shift supervisor docks him half a day\'s pay for being late.\n\nPartaking of an illegal emigration operation, some of the people in Los Angeles were able to come up with some money which they use to acquire Elysium identification brands on their wrists, then they board three dilapidated looking shuttles, which take off and fly towards Elysium. The shuttles require codes, which were also stolen.\n\nA French-speaking woman named Delacourt (Jodie Foster) is the Defence Secretary for Elysium. When she\'s told about three unauthorized shuttles approaching, she overrides Executive Order 355 and activates a rogue sleeper agent on Earth named C.M. Kruger (Sharlto Copley). Kruger immediately grabs a shoulder-fired ground to air missile launcher and fires off four rockets. The rockets chase down the shuttles and destroy two of them, killing all 46 people on board. The other shuttle makes it to Elysium and lands. The rich folks in the area are all in a tizzy, as helicopters and robots give chase of the occupants of the shuttle.\n\nOne mother and her daughter who were on the shuttle that landed rush into a house and find a Med-Bed. The girl\'s wrist is scanned, and she is identified as an Elysium citizen. A machine then assesses her physical condition, determining she had multiple fractures, and begins repairing the broken bones.\n\nThe incident results in 32 arrests and 13 casualties, with two at-large. The at large were the mother and daughter, who are soon apprehended. All 34 are prepared for deportation back to earth.\n\nMax\'s friend Julio (Diego Luna), tries to entice him to come back into the auto theft game, but he refuses, wanting to complete his parole and find a way to get up to Elysium.\n\nAt Max\'s workstation, a pallet jams the door to the firing unit for the robots. The supervisor orders Max to clear the door or he will lose his job. Max has no choice but to squeeze into the chamber and push the pallet away from the door. When he does, the door slams shut and the unit powers on, giving Max a lethal dose of radiation. After he is finally dragged from the chamber and sent to a medical unit, he is told by another droid that he will die in five days of organ failure. Armadyne CEO John Carlyle (William Fichtner) goes down on the production floor to see what the emergency was. He sees Max lying on a bed in the infirmary and orders that Max be taken away, so he won\'t mess up the bedding. A robot gives Max some pills to help him deal with the inevitable discomfort and will keep him physically functional until he dies.\n\nPresident Patel summons Delacourt. She is brought before the President and his cabinet. They are not happy with her for ordering the shuttles shot down, and for using Kruger to do it. Delacourt is impudent, as she sasses Patel and all but calls him a coward who would see Elysium destroyed if not for people like her. Patel threatens to fire Delacourt if she screws up again. He orders her to stop using Kruger. When Kruger learns that he\'s not going to be utilized anymore, he becomes infuriated and feels betrayed.\n\nJulio sees Max returning from the infirmary, barely able to walk, and rushes to help him. Julio helps him take some of the pills. Max tells Julio that he wants to go see Spider (Wagner Moura), the rebel behind the illegal transports to Elysium, about getting to Elysium. Max is desperate to make the trip now, as he needs a Med-Bay to heal himself.\n\nFrey has a young daughter, Matilda (Emma Tremblay), who experiences seizures. She had been taking her to work with her, but was ordered to leave her daughter home, as the doctors weren\'t able to give her treatments.\n\nMax and Julio got to the high-tech rebel command centre where Max asks Spider for an identification brand and a ticket to Elysium, promising to come back and work for him. He reminds Spider that he did three years in prison for him. Spider decides to make Max an offer. If he\'ll plug into the brain of one of Elysium\'s high-ranking officials and obtain pass codes and other secret data that would provide Spider access to money, then he\'d make sure Max was able to get to Elysium.\n\nMax must submit to surgery by what appear to be nothing more than glorified tattoo artists. They attach a third-generation powered exoskeleton to Max\'s body and wire a data collection device to his brain. The exoskeleton gives Max the strength of a droid. Max tells Spider that his friend, Julio, had to be included in the deal, and that John Carlyle must be the high-level target.\n\nDelacourt, vowing to protect Elysium and her own power, bargains with Carlyle to create a program that can override Elysium\'s computer core to give her the Presidency. Carlyle would be beneficiary of a 200 year contract to provide essential services to the community of Elysium. Carlyle works up a new computer protocol called "Sabre Cerebral Defence," and programs it into his own brain device. He also encrypts it with a denial system that would prove lethal to anyone attempting to download and use the program. He then boards a shuttle for a flight to Elysium.\n\nMax, Julio (Diego Luna) and a team of Spider\'s men arm themselves and make use of two fast armoured vehicles. They are aware of Carlyle\'s planned flight to Elysium and they set out to intercept him. Max shoots an explosive device at the shuttle, which locks on near one of the engines. As there is only 15 seconds until the shuttle goes supersonic, the explosive device must be detonated in short order. Once the shuttle has cleared its launch facility and has travelled a short distance, the explosive is detonated, and the shuttle is forced to crash land.\n\nDelacourt calls Kruger as soon as she\'s informed that Carlyle\'s shuttle has gone down, and that a former felon named Max De Costa was responsible. Kruger demands that he be "reinstated" if he decides to go rescue Carlyle. Delacourt allows it, then arranges for two of Kruger\'s former associates to pick him up.\n\nMax and his men arrive at Carlyle\'s shuttle and are confronted by one of two droids who were on the shuttle with Carlyle. After a difficult fight, Max destroys one droid. One of the men then uses a device to cut through the hull of Carlyle\'s shuttle and provide access to him. However, the second droid exits on the opposite side and comes around to confront Max and the others. Max and the others exchange fire with the droid. One of the men is firing his weapon while keeping his body hidden, so he can\'t see where his rounds are going. Max warns him not to hit Carlyle, who is shot in the chest. Max then engages the droid in hand-to-hand battle, finally tearing it\'s head off.\n\nMax and his men quickly establish a head-to-head computer connection between Max and the quickly dying Carlyle, but something is wrong and Max\'s computer expert says he can\'t read the data being transferred. They are out of time, as Kruger and his cohorts have arrived. When Max tries to run, he collapses, and Julio has to pause to help him -- something about the downloaded data is causing him head pain. Kruger\'s weapons on the shuttle he\'s in are very effective. He shoots and flips over one of the vehicles Max and his men had been using.\n\nKruger lands his shuttle and gets out and attacks Max, stabbing him. Kruger is about to decapitate Max when Julio shoots Kruger in the neck. Kruger mercilessly runs his sword through Julio. Max recovers and shoots at Kruger, but Kruger uses a force field to avoid being killed. On Elysium, Delacourt orders that Max be captured but that his brain be left undamaged.\n\nCarlyle dies and Max is able to escape. As he stumbles along, with Kruger and his men in pursuit in the shuttle with sophisticated tracking equipment, an old lady hides Max under her cart filled with pigs, thus helping him evade detection. Kruger deploys six tracking discs that start flying around the city attempting to locate Max. Delacourt issues a "No Fly" order for all craft in the Los Angeles area, so that Kruger can search unimpeded. Kruger now knows what the data transfer between Carlyle and Max was all about.\n\nMax goes to see Frey, calling out to her on the street as she was leaving her job. He begs her for help, telling her she couldn\'t tell anyone. She takes him to her home where she has the necessary medical supplies to help him. As she\'s tending to his stab wound, she notices a tattoo he has, a circle and the letters M + F, the same thing she once wrote on his hand with an ink pen when they were children. Max is saved by Frey and he meets Matilda. Frey tells Max that Matilda has leukaemia. She asks Max to find a way to get Matilda to Elysium, so she can be cured. Max tells her it\'s too dangerous, and he can\'t do it. Matilda tells Max a story about a meerkat who is hungry, so he befriends a lonely hippo in order to get some fruit. The point of the story was to indicate how creatures in need can find ways to help one another. Max just says he\'s sorry and then he leaves.\n\nOne of the search discs finds Max once he\'s back out on the streets. Max throws a rock at it and knocks it out of the sky, but not before Kruger has seen Max. Kruger and his men quickly travel to Frey\'s place and bust in, demanding to know where Max is. They take Frey and Matilda with them in the shuttle.\n\nMax goes to see Spider and demands he fly him to Elysium immediately. Spider tells Max that there\'s a no-fly order in effect and it can\'t be done. Spider then connects to the port in Max\'s head to see what data had transferred from Carlyle\'s head. He quickly realizes it\'s a reboot program for Elysium, something of tremendous significance. Max realizes he can trade the data for his cure and decides to leave. Spider has to quickly order his men not to shoot Max. Max is desperate to get to Elysium so he can heal his radiation poisoning.\n\nMax returns to the site of the disc he\'d knocked out of the sky and he looks into its camera and tells Kruger to come get him. When Kruger arrives, Max produces a grenade and pulls the pin, telling Kruger that if he doesn\'t take him to Elysium, he will blow his own head off and destroy the reboot program. Kruger invites Max on board the shuttle, where Max is surprised to see Frey and Matilda. They start the 19 minute trip to Elysium.\n\nDelacourt lifts the no-fly restriction on L.A. Spider knows that Max is on a shuttle and bound for Elysium, as he\'d attached a tracking device to Max before he\'d taken off. Spider and two of his men get on their own shuttle and take off for Elysium.\n\nKruger sings softly to Matilda and kisses Frey on the forehead. He\'s feeling an attraction for Frey and is willing to help Matilda as a result. When one of Kruger\'s associates approaches Frey, Max tells the guy to back up. Kruger then lunges and grabs at the grenade in Max\'s hand. They struggle. Max and Kruger fall, and the grenade rolls free. It blows up and destroys half of Kruger\'s face. The shuttle also becomes uncontrollable and crash lands on Elysium.\n\nMax carries Matilda to a safe spot away from the shuttle, then opens the shuttle doors and goes back for Frey, who was trapped in her seat. He frees her and she goes and gets Matilda and carries her into a mansion as Elysium security forces are arriving. Max, meanwhile, has to fight with one of the bad guys on the shuttle. The second bad guy takes off after the girls. Frey places Matilda in a healing bed inside the mansion, but because Matilda isn\'t recognized as a legitimate citizen, the bed won\'t work. Kruger\'s goon arrives and tasers Frey. Max ends up getting tasered as well.\n\nDelacourt, who has told President Patel that because the intruders have committed an act of war and that she was now in charge, wants the data extracted from Max\'s head, which her expert tells her will kill Max. She\'s fine with that.\n\nSpider arrives in his clanky old shuttle, managing to land without incident. He immediately heads for where his tracking device indicates Max is.\n\nKruger\'s goons take Frey and Matilda away. They put Kruger in a machine which completely reconstructs his face and head in about 30 seconds. He then wakes up. He survived only because his brain had not been damaged by the grenade explosion.\n\nMax breaks loose from his bonds and disables the two lab techs who\'d been working on him. He forces one of them to tell him where Frey and Matilda had been taken.\n\nDelacourt approaches Kruger, who\'s still feeling out of sorts and very much on edge. When she starts criticizing him for stupidly crashing the shuttle in a suburban area, he angrily smashes the mirror he\'d been examining his face in. He picks up a fairly large piece and jams it into Delacourt\'s throat. She goes down, bleeding badly.\n\nKruger makes it clear that he intends to use the data deposited in Max\'s head to re-program Elysium and make himself the new president. Kruger tosses Delacourt into the room with Frey and Matilda. Kruger tells Frey that he was going to make sure her daughter is never healed. Kruger\'s goons start roaming around tossing grenades to take out Elysium\'s command and control structure. Matilda starts treating Delacourt\'s wound, but Delacourt stops her, preferring instead to die. Max calls Spider and they make their immediate plans. Max then heads for the armoury and takes the last of his pain pills.\n\nKruger is now outfitted in a military-grade exoskeleton far superior to Max\'s droid suit, then orders his goon to kill Frey and Matilda. The goon plans to have some fun with Frey first, but Max gets there first and he is of superhuman strength after taking those pills and he simply crushes the goon, slamming him against the floor. The second goon comes in shooting and Max grabs an automatic weapon and kills him.\n\nMax sends Frey to the surface with Matilda, telling Frey to get Matilda to a Med Bay, promising her that it will work this time. Max teams up with Spider, reminding Spider that they have a deal only if Frey gets her daughter to a Med Bay. Spider sends one of his men to help Frey.\n\nKruger blows up one of Spider\'s men. Some high frequency sounds are broadcast, which disables Max, as he can\'t bear them. Kruger then goes after Max with his sword. In a desperate fight on a high catwalk, Spider tackles Kruger before he can stab Max and Kruger\'s sword goes flying several levels below. Kruger then jams a knife into Spider\'s hand, taking him out of the fight.\n\nMax and Kruger engage in hand-to-hand combat. Max is losing the fight, when he suddenly executes a body flip and disengages Kruger\'s exoskeleton power source on the way down. Kruger manages to clip Max to a railing and then pulls the pin on a grenade, intending to blow them both up. Max pulls himself loose and flips both Kruger and the grenade over the railing. Kruger explodes in mid-air.\n\nSpider makes a cable connection to the port in Max\'s head at the same instant that Frey flips the switch on a Med Bay containing Matilda. Spider first confirms that Max wants him to proceed, as the data download process will be fatal to Max. Max confirms, but first he connects to Frey and tells her goodbye. Max then presses "Enter" on Spider\'s computer, just as President Patel arrives with security to arrest Spider. The Elysium reboot takes place and everyone on Earth becomes a citizen of Elysium. Max dies, Spider is released, Matilda is healed, and numerous Aid shuttles are sent to Earth to help the new citizens.']
['Edward Bloom (\n\nAlbert Finney\n\n), an entertaining and charismatic teller of tall tales, is a source of frustration to his only son, William (\n\nBilly Crudup\n\n) who grew up believing his father\'s stories until it became obvious they were lies. At Will\'s wedding, Will feels embarrassed by his father telling the guests an impossible-sounding story about the day of Will\'s birth, involving catching a giant catfish with his wedding ring as bait. Will feels that his father tells these huge lies just to get attention and confronts him angrily about it. Edward denies his son\'s accusations and they end up not speaking to each other for three years.\n\nThree years later, Will, now living in Paris, France, receives news that Edward has fallen ill with cancer, and that he might not have long to live. Will and his pregnant wife, Josephine (\n\nMarion Cotillard\n\n) travel to Ashton, Alabama, Will\'s hometown. They have a reunion with Sandra K. Bloom (\n\nJessica Lange\n\n), Edward\'s wife and Will\'s mother, who is bringing Edward home from the hospital to take care of him in what they believe to be his final days. Edward is weak and bedridden, but he and Will finally speak again. Will asks to know the truth about his father\'s life. Edward retells his version of his childhood....\n\nIn a flashback, a young Edward (Scott Christopher Mcpherson Jr.) and two of his friends meet a witch (\n\nHelena Bonham Carter\n\n) living in a swamp who has a glass eye which supposedly reveals the eventual death of anyone who looks into it. While everyone else usually cowers in front of the witch, Edward insists on seeing his death. Edward sees how he will die (though the audience does not), and concludes that he can now take unreasonable risks because he knows they won\'t kill him. Soon afterward, Edward begins to grow at an alarming rate and is hooked up to a machine in bed, as his muscles and bones cannot keep up with his "body\'s ambition." In an encyclopedia, young Edward reads that a goldfish will remain small if kept in a small bowl, but will grow bigger in a larger habitat. Because he is growing so fast, he concludes he is meant for bigger things.\n\nWith the confidence that he can do anything he wants and a huge amount of ambition, as a teenager, Edward Bloom (\n\nEwan McGregor\n\n) grows into a high school star athlete, a star entrepreneur, and a local hero. When a mysterious "monster" comes to town and eats livestock during the night, Edward volunteers to talk to it and get it to leave. Edward tracks down the culprit, a gloomy but goodhearted giant named Karl (\n\nMatthew McGrory\n\n), and persuades him to move to a bigger city. Edward explains that Ashton is too small a town for men of Karl\'s size and Edward\'s ambition. He then offers the giant to leave with him. The two leave town, and Edward is given the key to Ashton by the mayor.\n\nThey approach a forest, which Edward wants to take a shortcut through but Karl doesn\'t. He promises to meet Karl on the other side, and ventures through the woods (which are full of thorns, spiders, and bees). He stumbles across the hidden town of Spectre, a seemingly perfect place where no one wears shoes. When he enters the town, he is greeted by Beamen, the mayor (singer/songwriter \n\nLoudon Wainwright III\n\n), his wife Mildred (\n\nMissi Pyle\n\n) and their 8 years old daughter Jenny (\n\nHailey Anne Nelson\n\n). The mayor has a clipboard that says Edward was meant to be in their town, but he\'s arrived early. Beamen tells Edward of the poet, Norther Winslow, who is also from Ashton. Jenny steals his shoes and flung them up onto a high rope at the entrance of the town, along with many other pairs that were taken from each townsperson upon their arrival in Spectre in an effort to keep them there. Spectre is the perfect town where everything is comfortable and everyone is delighted. At night, Edward encounters a mermaid in a pond near Spectre, but she swims away before he can see her face.\n\nAfter spending one day and night in the mysterious town, Edward realizes he has indeed arrived too soon and is not ready to settle down. He shocks the townspeople by politely excusing himself to get on with his journey. Jenny challenges him that he doesn\'t have his shoes anymore but Edward simply decides to continue his trek barefoot. He promises a smitten little Jenny that he will return someday.\n\nEdward rejoins Karl on the main road after losing his key to Ashton when it seemed to him like the forest itself was attacking him.\n\nHe and Karl stumble upon a circus, where Karl is immediately hired as an attraction by the owner and ringmaster, Amos Calloway (\n\nDanny DeVito\n\n), and his clown/attorney, Mr. Soggybottom (\n\nDeep Roy\n\n), when Karl proves to be much more impressive than their local giant. Edward spots a beautiful girl in the big-top audience and experiences love at first sight but she is whisked out the door with the crowd before he can speak to her. She turns out to be a family friend of Calloway\'s. Certain that she is the woman he will marry, Edward begs Calloway for a job, asking for only one piece of information about the girl for every month of work. Edward then spends the next three years toiling hard at the circus for free and learning casual trivia about the girl of his dreams such as the fact that she loves daffodils and music. Three years later, tired of living without a name, Edward goes to confront Calloway only to discover that Amos is a werewolf. Instead of killing the beast, Edward decides to treat it like a dog and plays with it all night. To reward Edward for his refusal to harm Amos in his monstrous state, Amos tells Edward the girl\'s name is Sandra Templeton and he can find her studying at Auburn University. Edward leaves the circus with Mr. Calloway\'s blessing and sets off to find Sandra.\n\nIn the present day, the elderly Edward befriends his daughter-in-law, Josephine, but is still at odds with his son, who believes him to be a liar. Will begs his father to be himself, but Edward firmly retorts "I\'ve been nothing but myself since the day I was born, and if you can\'t see that, it\'s your failing, not mine!"\n\nIn the flashback tall tale, upon reaching the university where Sandra Templeton (\n\nAlison Lohman\n\n) is a student, the young Edward finally meets her and explains that he loves her. She is kind to him and has heard of his accomplishments in Ashton, but is already engaged to Edward\'s hapless rival, Ashton native, Don Price (\n\nDavid Denman\n\n). Still determined, Edward finds not-so-subtle ways to woo Sandra. One morning, Sandra awakens to find her lawn covered in daffodils provided by Edward. However, Don Price appears and begins to brutally beat Edward, who had promised Sandra he would not fight back. But as Sandra sees Don\'s cruelty, she breaks the engagement, and eventually does marry Edward. Edward later reveals that Don died from a sudden heart attack while sitting on a toilet only a few years later (as Don had seen in the witch\'s glass eye).\n\nWhile recovering in the hospital from his fight injuries, Edward receives a draft notice, forcing him to enlist for the Korean War. While sad to leave his new wife, Edward knows from the glass eye that nothing from the war will kill him. Thus, he volunteers for the most dangerous missions available in hopes of being released sooner. While parachuting into a North Korean army base during a show for the troops to steal some important documents, Edward meets struggling Siamese twin singers Ping (\n\nAda Tai\n\n) and Jing (\n\nArlene Tai\n\n) who are performing that night. He offers to help them break into American show business if they can help him get back home to which the twins agree. However, the U.S. Army lists him as missing and presumably dead, sending a telegram to a heartbroken Sandra. (In the present day, Sandra finds the telegram and shows it to Will, proving that there is some truth to Edward\'s stories.) After a few months of low key traveling, Edward is able to rejoin his wife. He then took a job as a traveling salesman to buy them a better house.\n\nIn line at a bank one day, the younger Edward encounters Norther Winslow (\n\nSteve Buscemi\n\n), a native of Ashton he met years before in Spectre. Norther, inspired by Bloom leaving, has since left Spectre too and has become an outlaw. He then ropes Edward into assisting him in robbing the bank. However, the bank has literally no cash for them to steal. Edward then spends the next few hours explaining to Norther how the world of finances works now. Norther resolves to go to Wall Street, where the real money is, where he becomes a wealthy businessman. He later sends Edward $10,000 as a thank you note, which Edward uses to buy a house for Sandra and a young Will.\n\nBack in the present day, while in bed, Josephine asks Will if he loves his father, and he tells her that he was never around when he was a kid, saying, "He likes his second life better, and the reason he tells these stories is because he can\'t stand this boring place." Josephine disagrees, and tells Will that he should talk to his father.\n\nThe next day, still unimpressed by his father\'s stories, Will demands to know the truth, but Edward explains that he is who he is: a storyteller. While doing his own investigation into his father\'s stories, Will finds paper traces of the small town of Spectre. He travels to Spectre where he meets Jenny Hill, Beaman\'s daughter now all grown up. Although they never met before, Jenny recognizes Edward\'s son right away. Jenny tells Will the story of how she met Edward for the second time in her life, although this time, he was late.\n\nYoung Edward is driving his car one night through an overwhelming thunderstorm, when his car gets completely submerged underwater. A beautiful naked woman swims by the car, and presses her hand against his window. Edward recognizes the mermaid from that one night, a long time ago, in Spectre. The next day, Edward\'s car gets stuck in a tree and Edward finds his key to the city of Ashton. He wanders back into downtown Spectre, which is now no longer a beautiful oasis, but a depressed and abandoned ghost town. A new road has brought the outside world to Spectre, and with it banks, liens, and debt. Almost everywhere you look, people are now bankrupt. Edward gets in touch with a few of his friends including Norther Winslow, the Siamese twins, and the Calloway circus to put together an offer to buy back the town and save it from bankruptcy. In order to truly own the town and make sure it is safe, Edward needs everyone to sign over their deeds to him and his group. Everyone in Spectre agrees except Jenny who still holds a grudge against Edward for not coming back for her like he promised a long time ago.\n\nSeeing the condition of her home, Edward begins to fix it up himself, with the help of Karl the giant. At this point, Will asks Jenny directly if she was having an affair with his father. Jenny reveals that she still had feelings for Edward and that one night, when every little thing in her house was fixed, she signed over the deed to her house to Edward and then made a move on him but he stopped everything because he only had feelings and love for his wife Sandra. She also explains that, after saving the town, Edward never returned to Spectre and the night she tried to kiss him was the last night they ever saw each other. She adds that she became part of Edward\'s tales while Sandra and Will were always his true story.\n\nUpon his return to Ashton, Will finds out his father has had a stroke and is now hospitalized. Everyone is worried but Edward keeps telling everyone that this is not the death he saw in the glass eye. Will sends his mom and his wife home to rest while he spends the night at his father\'s bed. During the evening, Will encounters the family doctor, who had delivered him and is now treating Edward. Will asks to know the real story of his birth, having only heard his father\'s catfish story in the past. The doctor explains that it was simply a normal birth that Edward missed because he was working, and though Edward exaggerated it, hearing his story was a lot more entertaining and comforting than the truth. Will decides to reconcile with his dying father, finally understanding that his stories were only meant to entertain and comfort and were not lies created to cover up some boredom or disappointment.\n\nLater that night, Will finds Edward only partially conscious, and unable to speak at length. Since Edward can no longer tell stories, he asks Will to tell him the story of how his life ends. Will tells his father that he doesn\'t know that story since Edward never told him what he saw in the glass eye. Edward keeps insisting and Will realizes it\'s up to him to finish the story. Deciding to play along, Will tells his own impromptu tall tale: Edward regains strength, and he and Will escape from the hospital. Jumping into Edward\'s old car, they speed up to a nearby river, where everyone Edward has ever met are waiting. Instead of a funeral, they are holding a goodbye party, and Edward happily bids them farewell as Will carries him into the river where Edward transforms into a giant catfish and swims away. Edward agrees with Will that this is exactly how he dies. Shortly afterwards, Edward dies. Will is the only one present for Edward\'s death, and is both sad but also deeply happy that they finally connected at last.\n\nAt Edward\'s funeral, Will, Josephine and Sandra along with Edward\'s doctor are initially the only ones in attendance. Then a long line of cars, vans and buses arrive and it is here that Will becomes astonished to see all of the characters from Edward\'s stories show up to pay their respects to Edward; Amos Calloway, Karl the Giant, Norther Winslow, Older Jenny, Mr. Soggybottom, Ping and Jing, Mayor Beamen of Spectre are all present. However, each one of them is slightly less fantastical than they\'re described in Edward\'s stories. For example, Karl is not a 12-foot giant, but is still quite tall at around seven feet; Ping and Jing are not conjoined twins, just identical. It finally becomes clear that Edward had simply combined his love of storytelling with his own reality, which finally makes sense to Will. When his own son is born, Will passes the stories on to him, remarking that his father became his stories -- allowing him to live forever.']
['Equilibrium is set in the futuristic, and dystopian city-state of Libria. The film explains how, in the early years of the 21st century, a devastating Third World War breaks out, the impact of which brings civilizations across the planet to their knees. After the war ends, world leaders fear that the human race cannot possibly survive a Fourth World War, and so set about building a new society which is free of conflict.\n\nBelieving that human emotion is responsible for man\'s inhumanity to man, the new leaders ban all materials deemed likely to stimulate strong emotions, including art, music, and literature. These materials are rated "EC-10" for "emotional content" (a reference to the MPAA film rating system), and are typically destroyed by immediate incineration. Furthermore, all citizens of Libria are required to take regular injections, called "intervals," of a liquid drug called Prozium, collected at the distribution centers known as "Equilibrium".\n\nLibria is governed by the Tetragrammaton Council, which is led by a reclusive figurehead known as "Father". Father never interacts with anyone outside the ruling council, but his image is omnipresent throughout the city in a strong cult of personality. The Tetragrammaton Council strives to create identical lives for all Librians and uses its police state apparatus to enforce unity and conformity. At the pinnacle of Librian law enforcement are the Grammaton Clerics, who are trained in the deadly martial art of Gun Kata, an art which teaches users to predict the actions of opponents during firearm combat. The Clerics exist for the purpose of locating and destroying EC-10 materials and for pursuing, apprehending, and, if necessary, terminating "sense-offenders" - people guilty of feeling emotions.\n\nDespite the efforts of the police and Clerics, a resistance movement exists in Libria, known as "The Underground". Members of this movement are responsible for terrorist activity against Libria, specifically against the Prozium factories. The leaders of the Underground believe that if they can disrupt the production and distribution of Prozium for a short period of time, even a single day, then the Librians will rise up and destroy the Tetragrammaton Council. The Underground operates within Libria itself, but also has contact with resistance groups residing in "The Nethers", the ruins of cities destroyed during World War III. These outsiders hoard objects and artefacts from the old society before World War III, including art and literature. Subsequently, they are the targets of Librian death squads composed of police and Clerics.\n\nThe film\'s protagonist, Grammaton Cleric First Class John Preston (Christian Bale), is Libria\'s highest ranking cleric. He is a widower whose wife (Maria Pia Calzone) was executed after being revealed to be a sense offender, leaving him with two children, Robbie (Matthew Harbour) and Lisa (Emily Siewert). After a raid on a group of resistance members in The Nethers, Preston notices that his partner, Grammaton Cleric First Class Errol Partridge (Sean Bean), has personally taken a copy of the poems of Yeats under false pretenses. Preston discovers that Partridge has not turned the book over for destruction and follows him to a ruined cathedral in The Nethers, where Partridge speaks of emotion and forces Preston to aid him in suicide by cop. Shortly afterwards, Preston accidentally breaks the vial of his morning dose of Prozium, and begins to experience emotions.\n\nPreston is assigned a new partner, the career-conscious Brandt (Taye Diggs). Following a standard police raid on a Librian woman, Mary O\'Brien (Emily Watson), who has stopped taking Prozium, his emotional confusion is exacerbated during her interrogation. He first acts out of emotion when he makes an excuse not to execute a puppy in The Nethers. Preston has by now ceased taking Prozium and is forced to try and maintain his monotone and emotionless faade in front of his son and the increasingly suspicious Brandt. Over the course of the film, Preston\'s behavior increasingly mirrors that of Partridge in the beginning, even to the point of repeated dialogue.\n\nSoon, Preston is involved in illegal activities. During one visit to the Nethers, he is forced to kill several Librian policemen who find the rescued puppy in his car. Brandt, having seen Preston re-arranging his desk (signaling a dislike of conformity) and refusing to personally execute resistance members during a raid in the Nethers, becomes more suspicious. In consequence, Preston is summoned before Vice-Counsel DuPont (Angus Macfadyen), and explains that he is attempting to infiltrate the Resistance in order to destroy it. DuPont tells him that he has heard rumors of a cleric attempting to join the Resistance, and Preston promises to find this traitor. Preston soon makes contact with the Resistance. He agrees to assassinate Father (Sean Pertwee), an act which will create enough confusion for the Underground to detonate bombs in Libria\'s Prozium factories and hopefully bring down the Tetragrammaton Council. However, watching Mary O\'Brien\'s execution in Libria\'s furnaces causes Preston to weep uncontrollably, and Brandt arrests him.\n\nBrandt brings Preston before DuPont; Preston, however, tricks DuPont into believing Brandt was the criminal. Apparently cleared, Preston is released. He returns home to destroy his stashed Prozium before police find it, and is confronted by his young son, who reveals to Preston that he and his sister have not taken Prozium for some time, and have hidden his cache of Prozium. As part of an elaborate plot formed with the Underground, the leaders of the Resistance turn themselves in to Preston, who persuades DuPont to grant him an audience with Father.\n\nPreston arrives for his audience with Father, and is confronted by Father in a sudden reversal. Via a telescreen, Father speaks to Preston, revealing that he has been aware of Preston\'s sense-offense, and has staged Brandt\'s arrest in order to lull Preston into a false sense of security and allow him to think that his assassination scheme can go ahead. The face on the telescreen changes, revealing the face of Vice-Council DuPont, who explains that the real Father died years before, and that the Tetragrammaton Council elected DuPont as the new Head of State.\n\nPreston, however, embarks on a rampage using concealed pistols that he uses in order to reach Brandt and DuPont. Preston and Brandt face each other using paired short swords (similar in size and shape to the Japanese wakizashi), but Preston easily dispatches Brandt. Preston and DuPont then confront each other with handguns in a battle of Gun Kata masters, during which Preston manages to get the upper hand and kills DuPont. Preston then destroys the propaganda machines which broadcast across Libria, and the device which projects holographic images of Father. Realizing that the Tetragrammaton Council is faced with a crisis, the Underground detonates their bombs and the prisoners are released.\n\nThe film ends with a riot signaling the destruction of the Librian government.']
['On February 1, self-centered and sour TV meteorologist Phil Connors (\n\nBill Murray\n\n), news producer Rita Hanson (\n\nAndie MacDowell\n\n) and cameraman Larry (\n\nChris Elliott\n\n) from fictional Pittsburgh television station WPBH-TV9 travel to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities with Punxsutawney Phil, the Groundhog. Having grown tired of this assignment, Phil begrudgingly gives his Groundhog Day report the next day (February 2) during the festival and parade.\n\nAfter the celebration concludes, a blizzard develops that Connors had predicted would miss them, closing the roads and shutting down long-distance phone services, forcing the team to return to Punxsutawney. However, Connors awakens the next morning to find it is February 2 again, and his day unfolds in almost exactly the same way. Connors can change his behavior, but other people do and say the same things they did and said the previous day, unless Connors changes something. He is aware of the repetition, but everyone else seems to be living February 2 for the first time. This recursion repeats the following morning and the one after that, and over and over again. For Connors, Groundhog Day begins each morning at 6:00 A.M., when he wakes up in his room in a Victorian bed and breakfast. His clock radio is always playing the same song, "I Got You Babe" by Sonny & Cher. His memories of the "previous" day are intact, but he is trapped in a seemingly endless time loop, repeating the same day in the same small town.\n\nAfter briefly trying to rationalize his situation, and then thinking he is insane, Connors takes advantage of learning the day\'s events and the information he is able to gather about the town\'s inhabitants, and finds that his actions have no long-term consequences for himself. He revels in this situation for a time: seducing beautiful women, stealing money, even driving drunk and experiencing a police chase. However, his attempts to seduce his producer, Rita, are met with repeated failures. He begins to tire of, and then dread, his existence, starting the day by smashing the alarm clock and professing the inanity of Groundhog Day as a holiday in his newscast. In a vain attempt to break the cycle, he kidnaps Phil the Groundhog. After a police pursuit, Connors drives a stolen truck into a quarry, causing both man and rodent to die in a fiery explosion; but the loop does not stop. He commits suicide several more times. He electrocutes himself, lets a truck hit him on the road, and jumps from a tall building (other attempts are alluded to) but mere death cannot stop the day from repeating. After he dies, he simply wakes up listening to Sonny & Cher in the same bed, on the same day, over and over again.\n\nHe initially tries to seduce Rita by learning as much as he can on a daily basis. First he asks what she wants in a man: someone who is humble, kind, generous, courageous and sensitive; someone who likes children; someone who loves his mother and plays a musical instrument. He learns what she likes (rocky road ice cream, sweet vermouth, French poetry) and what she doesn\'t like (white chocolate) and pretends to share her tastes. This also fails consistently; in scene after scene, Rita slaps him before the night is over. However, he is able to befriend her in a more sincere fashion. He tells her of his circumstances -- how he is reliving the day over and over again -- and manages to convince her of the truth with his extensive knowledge of events to come, the lives of the Punxsutawney townspeople, and Rita herself.\n\nHe opens his heart to Rita, and her advice helps him to gradually find a goal for his trapped life: as a benefactor to others. He cannot, in a single day, bring others to fulfill his needs but he can achieve self-improvement by educating himself on a daily basis. After seeing an elderly homeless man die, Connors vows that no one will die on "his" day and performs many heroic services each and every repeating day, including performing the Heimlich maneuver on a choking man and saving a little boy who falls from a tree. However, he becomes despondent at being unable to save the homeless man, despite trying to get him medical care. When he demands to see the man\'s medical chart, a nurse tells him "sometimes people just die." Connors replies "Not today," but he never manages to prevent it.\n\nThough the film does not specify the number of repetitions, there is enough time for Connors to learn many complex skills, such as how to play jazz piano, speak French, sculpt ice, and memorize the life story of almost everyone in town. He also masters the art of flipping playing cards into an upturned hat, which he offhandedly suggests takes six months.\n\n(According to \n\nDanny Rubin\n\n, who shares screenwriting credit with the director, the intent in the original script was for the time-frame of Connors\' repeating days to be ambiguous, but longer than a single lifetime. The studio objected to this, asking that it be reduced to two weeks. Director \n\nHarold Ramis\n\n tried to leave the time-frame loop ambiguous as how many times Connors relives February 2, but it is strongly speculated by Connors (and the viewers) to be at least 10 years.)\n\nEventually, Phil sees his own shadow, so to speak, and changes from an inconsiderate, callous egocentric into a thoughtful, kindhearted philanthropist, refining his understanding of human decency, which, in return, makes him an appreciated and beloved man in the town. Phil is able to befriend almost everyone he meets during the day, using his experiences to save lives and help the townspeople. In the process, he gets closer to Rita. He crafts a report on the Groundhog Day celebration so eloquent that all the other stations turn their microphones to him. After the big Groundhog Day evening dance, Rita and Phil retire together to Phil\'s room. They believe that if Rita is there, the cycle may be interrupted. He wakes the next morning in bed with Rita (they are both still fully clothed) and finds the time loop is broken; it is now February 3. Phil is a different person than he was on February 1 and, after going outside, Phil and Rita talk about living in Punxsutawney together. Connors suggests: "We\'ll rent to start."\n\nThe closing song is "Almost Like Being in Love" from Brigadoon, a musical which also dealt with a village trapped in time.']
['The film opens at the supermarket Shopwell\'s on a new day as customers are rolling in. The food there live in their own world where they greet each morning with a song about "The Great Beyond", where the "gods" (shoppers) take the food to their ultimate destiny.\n\nA pack of sausages and a bag of buns are placed next to each other during a 4th of July weekend sale. Frank (voice of Seth Rogen) is a sausage that wants to finally get all up in his bun girlfriend Brenda (voice of Kristen Wiig). He shares the pack with his buddies Carl (voice of Jonah Hill) and Barry (voice of Michael Cera). Barry is the smallest sausage and is mocked by Troy (voice of Anders Holm) and his pals. All the sausages and buns think they are destined to get together in The Great Beyond. For now, Frank and Brenda can only touch tips. They then witness one of the store\'s employees, Darren (voice of Paul Rudd), whom the food refer to as "the dark lord", coming around and throwing out all the expired food, despite the food pleading and insisting that they are still good.\n\nLater in the day, Honey Mustard (voice of Danny McBride) gets returned to Shopwell\'s. He is trembling in fear and appears traumatized, unable to speak about what he has just seen. As this happens, a shopper named Camille Toh (voice of Lauren Miller-Rogen) picks up the sausages and buns, and then Honey Mustard. While the rest of the food in the cart is celebrating being chosen, Honey Mustard stands up and tells the food that everything they have been led to believe about the gods and The Great Beyond is a bunch of bullshit. He says that the gods are preparing them for unspeakable horrors. Refusing to go back, Honey Mustard gets ready to leap off the cart. Frank gets out of his package and runs to catch him, leading Brenda to leave her bag to save Frank. Before falling, Honey Mustard tells Frank to seek out Firewater (voice of Bill Hader) to learn the answers he seeks. Another shopper then bumps his cart into Camille\'s, causing Honey Mustard to fall and crash. Several other products fall and become damaged. Banana\'s face peels off, Jelly gets splattered, a bag of chips gets popped and his chips slice the other food, and a can of noodles has his guts spill out.\n\nFrank and Brenda escape the chaos, but the store is now closed and they\'re away from their packages. They run into a douche named...Douche (voice of Nick Kroll), who\'s pissed that his nozzle is bent and therefore he cannot fulfill his purpose to have a woman use him. Douche tries to come at Frank and Brenda, but Darren sweeps him up into the garbage.\n\nDouche climbs out of the garbage bin and finds that his side is cracked, causing his juices to leak. He cries about not getting to do what he\'s made for. Douche then spots a broken grape juice box. He goes over to it and is then inspired to seek out revenge on Frank and Brenda. Douche drinks out of the box\'s crotch and gets juiced up, ready to get payback.\n\nFrank and Brenda head back to their aisles and meet the Armenian flatbread Lavash (voice of David Krumholtz) and Jewish Sammy Bagel, Jr (voice of Edward Norton). The two of them hate each other, as their food groups are made to believe they should. The four of them discover the aisles that form a city in the grocery store. Frank spots the liquor aisle and decides to seek out Firewater. They head down that aisle, and Frank finds Firewater\'s spot. He leaves Brenda with Lavash and Sammy as he goes to talk to Firewater.\n\nFrank encounters Firewater sitting around a fire. Frank asks him what Honey Mustard was talking about. Firewater explains that once the food goes out the door, the gods kill their asses. Thinking Frank has heard too much, Firewater puts a bag over his head and prepares to have him killed, but one of his friends talks him out of it. Frank then meets the Non-Perishables, which also include Mr. Grits (voice of Craig Robinson) and Twink (voice of Scott Underwood).\n\nBrenda goes looking for Frank and runs into Tequila (also Bill Hader), who says he knows where to find Frank. He takes Brenda, Lavash, and Sammy to a pub in the Mexican food aisle. Teresa Del Taco (voice of Salma Hayek) sees Brenda and becomes smitten with her. However, she knows that the three are being brought in for a trap. Teresa hides them as Douche arrives. He smashes Tequila and drinks his fluids, getting even more juiced up. Teresa leads the food out a secret passageway.\n\nFrank sits with the Non-Perishables as they smoke sativa from their pipe. Firewater admits that because they are Non-Perishable, and therefore immortal, they have seen the barbaric nature of the gods long before the rest of the food in the store, knowing full well what awaits them once they are out the doors. So, they made up the tale of the gods being saviors so that the next wave of food would leave the store happy instead of terrified. Firewater says they also made up the song (he made the tune, Twink made the lyrics), but other food have changed up the meaning to their liking, which upsets Firewater. Frank decides he has to warn everyone about what awaits them. Firewater tells him to go down the Dark Aisle in order to find the proof that he needs to get the food to realize what is really happening.\n\nAt Camille\'s house, all the food is excited to see what they are in for. Camille picks out Potato (voice of Greg Tiernan) first. He is elated and thinks he is about to enter eternity...until Camille starts peeling his skin off, and then drops him into a pot of boiling water. The food then become horrified when a tomato gets chopped in half, a lettuce head is split in two, cheese is grated and microwaved onto nachos, and bacon is fried alive! Two little baby carrots try rolling away to freedom, but Camille catches them and eats them. Carl and Barry make a run for it out the window. They prepare to jump into the bushes when Camille sticks a knife through Carl and slices him upwards. Barry avoids the same fate as he falls into the bushes.\n\nBrenda, Teresa, Lavash, and Sammy walk down the back of the aisle. Brenda thinks all the bad stuff is happening because she and Frank touched tips, and now the gods are punishing her. Teresa admits that she has urges that she cannot give into for fear of angering the gods. They are then attacked by the jacked-up Douche. He is about to kill Brenda until she rips off the sticker that kept his juices from leaking. The food manages to escape from Douche as he gets stuck in the walls.\n\nBarry is now out in the streets, scared out of his wits. He finds a turd with zombie corn, and then a used condom who laments what he was used for. Barry hides and sees a Druggie (James Franco) stopping by with a Shopwell\'s bag. The Druggie buys bath salts and walks away. Barry thinks the man can help him get back to Frank to warn him. He runs after the Druggie and hangs onto his shoelace as he drives home.\n\nFrank reunites with his friends and tries to get them to follow him to the dark aisle so that he can show them proof of what the gods really do with them. However, Brenda remains firm in her beliefs and feels hurt that Frank would start badmouthing the gods right now. She decides that she would rather go to The Great Beyond without Frank and gets filled with something else, like an eggplant or tube of toothpaste, to Frank\'s horror. Brenda returns to her aisle and tearfully parts from Teresa. Meanwhile, Lavash and Sammy discover they have a common friend with Hummus, but they remain unable to put their differences aside and return to their arguing groups.\n\nNow at the Druggie\'s home, Barry tries to sneak into the Shopwell\'s bag. The Druggie them shoots up the bath salts and starts tripping balls. This causes him to be able to see, hear, and speak to Barry, as well as the other food in his room. The Druggie freaks out when he sees the half-eaten and conscious food, as well as the mortified Toilet Paper (voice of Conrad Vernon). Barry then meets a Stephen Hawking-like wad of gum named...Gum (also Scott Underwood), who is the most intelligent being in the world, having been stuck under the desk of a brilliant scientist for decades. Gum figures out how to get Barry back to the closest Shopwell\'s. The Druggie agrees to help Barry get home, but first he passes out.\n\nFrank goes down the Dark Aisle and finds a big recipe book. It contains disturbing depictions of the gods chowing down on food as it is fully aware of being eaten. Frank then sees the page with a sausage and bun being eaten. He rips that page out and sets out to tell the truth.\n\nThe Druggie wakes up, but the effects of the bath salts wear off and he can\'t understand the food anymore. He starts eating the bag of chips, and then reaches for Barry. He goes to throw him in a boiling pot of water.\n\nIt is now morning, and the store is about to open. Frank gets himself on camera and speakers to talk to all the food. He tries to explain to them that the gods are going to kill them and not take them to a Great Beyond. Frank shows off the pages of the recipe book, but the food thinks he is just speaking blasphemy and making things up. Frank leaves, defeated, but then reunites with Barry. He brings with him the decapitated head of the Druggie. We see how Barry managed to miss the boiling water, leading the Druggie to try and pick him up, only to knock over the pot and burn himself. Barry grabbed his shoelace and made him slip, causing him to fall and have an axe from from the wall and chop his head off, so Barry and the rest of the Druggie\'s food (plus Toilet Paper). With this revelation, Frank knows someone else has witnessed the barbarity of the gods firsthand. But now that they know the gods can be killed, the food sets out to stop them once and for all.\n\nFrank sees that Brenda is about to be taken away in another package. He races to get her while Barry has the house foods cook the bath salts and dip toothpicks in them, which they shoot at the shoppers and employees. They start to trip out and see the sentient food. The lady with Brenda\'s package freaks out and tries to run. Frank locks the store down, causing the woman to slam into the door. She grabs Frank, but Brenda whacks her face to the ground. The food tries to get the shopper\'s attention, but a woman slams a pizza slice against the door. The other shoppers start smashing the food when they see it\'s alive. This proves to the food that the gods are monsters. They decide it\'s time to fight back once and for all!\n\nThe candy aisle shoots gumballs at an obese man. A bottle of cola and a tube of Mentos sacrifice themselves to go down the man\'s throat and blow him up. Other shoppers and employees get brutally attacked by the food. Darren goes to get a gun and finds Douche speaking to him. He offers to form an alliance so they can both kill Frank. Douche jumps into Darren\'s pants and sticks his nozzle up Darren\'s ass to control him. They go hunting for Frank as Darren shoots the food. Frank is caught by Douche, who takes a bite out of him. Brenda swings down to save Frank while Barry and his friends set up a garbage bin with explosives that hurdles toward Darren and Douche. The bin snatches them up, and the food sets them up to get launched out of the store where they perish in a massive explosion.\n\nNow that the food has won, Frank and Brenda decide to do what they\'ve been wanting to do this whole time...get all up in each other. Lavash and Sammy come out with their feelings for each other and get in on the action, along with Teresa. The whole store them has one epic orgy, including the Non-Perishables, plus Barry and a smushed bun.\n\nAfter all the fun, Frank and his friends are guided by Gum to Firewater\'s lair. He tells them of another terrible truth - all of them are just cartoons coming from the mind of Seth Rogen and his buddies. Gum shows them a machine he\'s built for them to head out into the real world and cut the strings loose from these puppet masters. Frank and his friends hold hands as they make the leap into another crazy new world.']

['Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio), a backpacker, goes to Bangkok, Thailand, with the intention of experiencing something radically different from his familiar life. He meets Franoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and her boyfriend, tienne (Guillaume Canet) at his hotel. He also meets an eccentric and crazed man, Daffy (Robert Carlyle), who rants on about a beach paradise on a secret island and the parasites of civilization. Daffy later commits suicide but leaves Richard a map to the island, convincing him that it exists.\n\nRichard convinces Franoise and tienne to accompany him to the island, partly out of an infatuation for Franoise and the promise that it\'s something different from the typical tourist experience. They travel from Bangkok to the shores of Koh Samui in the Gulf of Thailand, where Richard befriends a pair of American surfers. They talk excitedly about the myth of the beach and how it has an almost unlimited supply of marijuana. Richard does not admit his knowledge, but later copies his map and slides it under their door the next morning, wrestling with his decision to inform them but deciding that world travelers aren\'t supposed to keep information from each other.\n\nTo finally reach the island, Richard, Franoise, and tienne must swim across to it. When they first arrive on the island, they come across an enormous marijuana plantation guarded by local farmers armed with AK-47 assault rifles, where they barely manage to evade detection. After jumping off cliff -- Franoise is the first to take the leap ahead of her reluctant male compatriots -- and landing in a lake below, they are seen by Keaty (Paterson Joseph), who takes them to the beach community. They are cautiously interrogated by the island\'s leader Sal (Tilda Swinton) regarding their knowledge of the island, but are accepted. The trio are introduced to everybody and over the next few days become integrated into the community.\n\nOne night while Richard and Franoise are walking down the beach, she tells him that she is falling in love with him. They swim out into the ocean to look at a swarm of bioluminescent plankton, where Franoise kisses Richard and has sex with him on the beach. Despite their attempts to keep the romance a secret, the whole island finds out about it, including tienne. Although devastated, tienne says he will not stand in their way if Francoise is happier with Richard.\n\nAt first the island and its community seem to live up to their reputation. Richard swims out into the ocean to catch fish with a harpoon and is attacked by a young mako shark, but he stabs it to death, which gains him much admiration, despite Sal\'s boyfriend, Bugs (Lars Arentz Hansen) objecting to the fact that it was a young shark with no hunting experience. Events take a turn for the worse when Richard is chosen to accompany Sal to the mainland to acquire supplies. People from the community line up to give Richard needed items to bring back. When Bugs talks to Richard, he viciously squeezes Richard\'s crotch, slyly warning him not to have sex with Sal.\n\nIn Koh Phangan, Richard is inadvertently reunited with the American surfers who are preparing to go to the beach with two girls. Richard tries to convince them that the beach turned out to be a myth after all but the surfers aren\'t so easily dissuaded and storm off when Richard becomes intensely belligerent with them. Sal overhears their conversation about the copy of the map and confronts Richard, who admits his "guilt" but doesn\'t admit he made a copy of the map. In exchange for Sal\'s silence and Richard\'s return to the island, Sal blackmails Richard into having sex with her that night.\n\nWhen they return to the island, everything returns to normal until the Swedes are attacked by a shark while fishing. Sten dies almost instantly and Christo is severely injured. The only options for Christo are to go to the mainland to get medical help or stay on the island and take his chances, as Sal refuses to allow a doctor to come to the island. Christo chooses to stay, not wanting to go near the water after his encounter with the shark. Christo\'s condition worsens, consistently lowering the morale of the whole community, so they take him out into the middle of the jungle and leave him to die. However, tienne, disgusted by the group\'s decision, vows to stay with Christo.\n\nLater, Sal spots the American surfers on the neighboring island and angrily charges Richard with the task of watching them so he can obtain the map and destroy it. While he\'s waiting for the surfers to arrive -- they stay on the other island for days, much to Richard\'s frustration -- Franoise shows up, furious and heartbroken, saying that Sal has told everybody about her tryst with Richard. Richard cannot cope with his task and retreats into the forest, where he becomes temporarily insane, believing that he is communing with the long-dead Daffy. He evades the other islanders and sets lethal traps in an attempt to keep them at bay, at times hallucinating that he is a character in a video game.\n\nMeanwhile, the surfers reach the island but are discovered and killed by the marijuana farmers before they can get to the beach. Richard witnesses their executions and retreats to the community to convince tienne and Franoise to leave the island, believing that all their lives are now in danger. tienne refuses, not wanting to leave the emaciated Christo, whose leg has become gangrenous. When the other two briefly leave the tent, Richard tearfully smothers Christo to death in a mercy killing. When he leaves the tent, however, he is struck across the face by a farmer and knocked unconscious.\n\nHe wakes up in a tent in pain, surrounded by the community and the farmers. The farmers approach Sal, with whom they had an agreement, and give her a gun loaded with a single bullet and an ultimatum: shoot Richard dead and be allowed to stay, or leave the island forever. Sal approaches Richard and fires an empty chamber, throwing the crowd into chaos. The lead farmer smiles as the community instantly disintegrates. Sal collapses in a flood of tears, as the crowd, now in hysterics, flees in droves to get away from the island. Together, they swim back to the mainland and go their separate ways.\n\nThe film ends with Richard stopping by an Internet cafe to check his mail. He receives a letter from Franoise titled "beach life" containing a photograph of the whole beach community and an animated handwritten inscription over the image: \'Parallel Universe. Love, Franoise X\'.']
['Frank Walker (George Clooney) is talking to an unseen audience about the future when a female voice interrupts him, tell him that his wording is a touch \'bleak.\' When the female asks him to think back to when he thought of the future as an optimistic place, he talks about when he went to the 1964 World\'s Fair in New York City as a child.\n\nYoung Frank (Thomas Robinson) eagerly enters the Hall of Inventions carrying a very large duffle bag containing his invention: a jet pack he made. Though the judge David Nix (Hugh Laurie) does not show much enthusiasm for the device (which Frank admits doesn\'t work properly), a little girl named Athena (Raffey Cassidy) seems to think Frank\'s invention has potential.\n\nOutside the hall, Athena catches up with Frank. Giving him a small pin, she requests that he follow her behind a small group. The group also includes Mr Nix, and some guests of his.\n\nPutting on the pin, Frank follows the group to the "It\'s a Small World" attraction, where Frank bypasses the line and boards one of the boats by himself. During the ride, a laser scans his pin, and he\'s suddenly plunged down a secret chute, underneath the ride. The boat Frank is on then pulls up at a small transport station.\n\nAfter a disorienting ride, Frank finds himself on a foggy platform, but sees a strange flying vehicle taking off nearby, with Athena waving to him. Frank attempts to follow, but finds himself on the edge of a platform. Suddenly, construction robots arise, creating new structures, but knocking Frank down to a lower level. As his jetpack clatters to the platform, a robot nearby suddenly grabs it. Frank fights to get back his invention, but he is surprised when the huge automaton fixes it. However, Frank inadvertently falls from this platform as well, but upon igniting his jetpack, he finds himself soaring amid a gleaming white cityscape unlike anything he\'s ever seen before. Eventually, he sees Athena and the others, and touches down right in front of Mr Nix...who only seems mildly amused that Frank\'s invention can actually fly. Even so, Athena gives the young boy a reaffirming smile.\n\nFrank then becomes pessimistic again, when the female voice interrupts that he\'s seeming negative again. When Frank asks if the unnamed voice would like to take over telling the story, it obliges. We are then introduced to Casey Newton (Britt Robertson), who happily proclaims she\'s \'an optimist.\'\n\nAfter a brief glimpse of a young Casey naming stars in the night sky, we cut to the modern day. Late one evening, Casey surreptitiously enters a Cape Canaveral, Florida NASA launch pad that is being demolished. She sabotages three construction cranes. When she returns home, her dad tells her \'the end\' of the space shuttle\'s former launch site is inevitable. Casey still feels she\'s contributing something with trying to slow down the deconstruction.\n\nUnseen by Casey, a dark figure trails her from the NASA site to her home, and quietly slips a small pin into her helmet, dangling from her motorcycle handlebar.\n\nThe next day, her father Eddie (Tim McGraw) laments how even though he\'s a NASA engineer, there\'s very little hope for him to do anything useful. Ever the Optimist, Casey reminds him of the metaphor of two wolves: light and hope, darkness and despair. In the end, as Eddie told Casey, the one who will win, is the one you feed.\n\nCasey goes to school, but becomes a bother in all her classes. Her teachers tell of nuclear annihilation, planetary meltdown, and governmental collapse, but Casey just wants to know one thing: "how can we fix it?" However, this question receives no answers.\n\nAfter hearing word that NASA has brought in working equipment from Orlando to continue disassembling the platform, Casey goes out to stop them, but is caught by NASA security.\n\nAfter her father bails her out of jail, Casey collects her things, but is surprised to find a small pin with the letter "T" on it. Picking it up, she is surprised when it seems to transport her to an endless field of wheat, with a futuristic city off in the distance.\n\nOn the ride home, Casey attempts to show the pin to her father, but when Eddie touches it, nothing happens.\n\nLater on that evening, Casey sneaks out of the house, and bicycles to a large field. Touching the pin this time, she finds herself in the center of a dazzling futuristic city, with jetpacks and hovertrains. She also becomes enamored seeing a rocket launch station, and follows a group of space travelers...before the pin suddenly runs out of power, and she finds herself having wandered waist-deep into a lake.\n\nWaking up her little brother Nate (Pierce Gagnon), she asks him for help trying to find another pin on the Internet. Their search takes them to a website of Blast From The Past, a store in Houston, Texas. Strangely, they only have a street address, but don\'t list an email or phone number.\n\nCasey tells Nate to cover for her while she takes a bus to Houston to talk to the store owners. The next day, Athena sees Nate in front of their home who asks to see Casey. When Nate attempts to tell Athena that Casey is away, she claims he\'s lying, and asks where she "really" is.\n\nArriving at Blast From The Past, Casey meets the store owners, Ursula (Kathryn Hahn), and Hugo (Keegan-Michael Key). They tell her that the pin supposedly was a key to showing a world created by some of the greatests geniuses in history, who called themselves Plus Ultra.\n\nWhen the two press Casey for more information on where she got the pin, her claims that she just \'found it\' cause the two to get upset. Things take a turn for the strange when the two grab two actual-working laser guns, and attempt to kill her.\n\nCasey is saved when Athena appears, stopping the two in their tracks with a time-bomb (a device that stops time temporarily in a 15 foot radius). As the two get free, Casey and Athena fight them, with Athena pulling off Ursula\'s head, and Hugo being skewered. Both Casey and Athena rush out of the store before Hugo self-destructs, with the small girl then breaking into a car, and allowing the two of them to get away.\n\nIn the car, Athena tells Casey that the two people they encountered, were Audio-Animatronic figures, and it was she (Athena) who gave Casey the pin. However, the fight has damaged Athena, and Casey panics when she realizes that the little girl is also a robot!\n\nCasey attempts to flee with Athena giving chase...but not before a truck slams into the small robot; Casey uses the opportunity to take the truck, but Athena quickly recovers, and chases after Casey, managing to catch up to her\' Athena claims she is from the place Casey saw when she touched the pin (which happened to be her last one.), but it may not be there much longer.\n\nAfter a small discussion, Casey is willing to accept that Athena will not harm her. Athena wishes them to drive to Pittsfield, New York, to meet a man named Frank Walker.\n\nBack in Houston, Police are combing through the wreckage of the store, when a black van pulls up, and several people get out, led by a smiling man who calls himself Dave Clark (Matthew MacCaull). When one of the officers finds the charred remains of Ursula\'s head, Dave pulls out a device that disintegrates the nearby officers. Once they are done away with, he informs the other members of his party to contact Governor Nix.\n\nEventually, driving all-night wears Casey out, and she relinquishes the driving duties to Athena...only to awaken on the side of a road, with Athena driving away!\n\nSeeing a mailbox nearby with the name "Walker" on it, she ignores the no trespassing sign and comes onto the property. She soon encounters a barking dog, but upon seeing it leaving no paw prints in the dirt, finds that it is simply a realistic hologram.\n\nGoing to the front door, a man on the other side tells Casey to leave. When she demands to be taken to the place the pin showed, a concussive blast sends her flying backward, and Frank emerges.\n\nWhile she pleads to be taken to the place she saw, Frank tells her it doesn\'t actually exist. What she saw was a \'commercial\' for this place, and they threw him out, and sealed off all ways to get back in.\n\nFrank once again tells Casey to leave, but she refuses to. As day turns to night, Casey notices a number of cables leading from the main house, and finds they are all attached to an array of antennas and satellite dishes.\n\nSetting a nearby tractor on fire, Casey gets Frank to leave the house, and get inside. Frank manages to put out the fire, but Casey refuses to let him back in until he takes her where she wants to go.\n\nExploring the house, she finds some futuristic-looking devices, and a room showing numerous world and political turmoil, along with a countdown clock, and a \'probability\' detector.\n\nFrank manages to get back in the house, and attempts to get Casey to leave once again, but she demands to know what she has just been witness to. When Frank realizes she won\'t just leave, he posits a question: "What if I could tell you the exact day you would die?"\n\nCasey claims she\'d naturally want to know, but then if she did find out, she wouldn\'t believe it, and would try to find some way to change the future. Suddenly, the monitors behind her all flicker, and the probability numbers drop by the smallest percentage...but it\'s still enough to make Frank take notice.\n\nSuddenly, sensors indicate intruders, and a black van with dark-suited figures is seen. Frank attempts to fortify his house, but the intruders break in, revealing they are audio-animatronic figures. Frank manages to grab some things and stuff them in a bag, before he and Casey get into a bathtub, which rockets them out of the house as the former inventor self-destructs his birthplace.\n\nThe tub lands in a nearby pond, and Casey and Frank emerge to find Athena in a truck nearby. The group begins to drive away from the house, but Frank quickly gets into a small argument with Athena.\n\nAthena ends up taking them to a television station, hoping Frank can take them to "The Spectacle." Frank at first refuses, but finally relents, willing to accompany them.\n\nLeading them into a utility shack, he reveals a secret underground entrance, wherein lies a teleportation machine. As he covers Casey\'s eyes and ears as part of the teleportation procedure, Frank asks why Athena chose someone like Casey.\n\n"Because she hasn\'t given up," the small automaton replies.\n\nIn a matter of moments, the three are transported to their new location: atop the Eiffel Tower, in Paris, France.\n\nAfter subduing a guard, the group find their way into a small room, wherein are figures of Thomas Edison, Gustave Eiffel, Jules Verne, and Nicola Tesla. Frank claims that the Eiffel tower functions as an antenna, and a secret gateway the men made, as an emergency entrance to reach their secret city. Frank reveals an Edison Tube, that when put on a phonograph, opens a secret entrance.\n\nAs the group watches, the tower splits in two, becoming a gantry, and a rocketship emerges from a compartment beneath the ground. Getting into the rocket, the three find French robots also attempting to stop them. However, the rocket blasts off before they can get to the three.\n\nAfter breaking free of Earth\'s gravity, the main compartment of the rocket flips around, and hurtles back towards Earth, breaking through into another dimension.\n\nThe three emerge near the rocket area that Casey saw in the commercial, only it\'s desolate and deserted. Seeing a group of vehicles approach, Frank hands Athena a small device: a 1-kiloton bomb the size of a small ball, that she hides in a compartment inside herself. Frank claims they may need it for leverage.\n\nAs the group watches, a hover train arrives, and Governor Nix emerges, looking just as he did when Frank first met him. Nix exchanges some short \'pleasantries\' with Frank and Athena, and is then introduced to Casey. It is here that Frank explains about the probability blip he saw, feeling she can change things.\n\nThe group then heads to a central tower, with a giant sphere nearby, sending energy into it. A platform transports the group up, with tachyons bathing the group, showing glimpses of things several moments in the future.\n\nAs the platform rises into the sphere, a globe rises up on a pedestal in the center of the room. Frank shows Casey that it can take people in and out of places, and go backwards and forwards in time, showing people the Earth. Casey tests it out, and Nix is surprised how quickly she adapts to using it.\n\nZeroing in on the NASA landing platform, Casey pushes into the future, but is surprised when the image becomes fuzzy. Pushing forward, she sees fire and smoke. Going over the globe, she sees other things: cities being destroyed, tornadoes and freak thunderstorms, before seeing her family\'s home underwater.\n\nFrank claims that what they see is said to be coming in a month\'s time or less. Casey is angered as to why Nix hasn\'t told anyone on Earth about what will happen, but Nix shows no reason to be concerned: what will happen will happen on Earth. The city will survive. When this prompts Casey to ask why Nix doesn\'t allow those on Earth to come to the city, he counters that there is too great of a risk for humans to destroy it, just like the Earth.\n\nCasey then shows her optimism by refusing to give in to what the machine has shown them, when suddenly, the panoramic view brightens, and the environment looks normal. Frank eagerly tells Nix that he has witnessed what he was talking about, but the Governor taps Frank with a device, knocking him out.\n\nFrank awakens in a confined room, with Athena and Casey nearby. Athena tells Frank he is once again to be banished, with Casey upset that Frank didn\'t tell her about the impending end of the world. Frank tells Case that he knows she\'s \'special,\' but her optimism seems to have dried up. Feeling lied to that the pin seemed broadcast into her mind a vision of a bright future...she suddenly comes to a startling conclusion.\n\nFrank\'s antennas and dishes were grabbing feeds of what the device was broadcasting. But what if it the machine isn\'t just predicting the future...it is causing people to give in to these visions, and just accept what will happen: a self-fulfilling prophecy doomsday device.\n\nThe three are brought before Nix, who has decided to banish them to a deserted island, via a portal. Frank attempts to tell Nix about what they found out, but he claims that shutting down the sphere won\'t make any difference. Casey is still upset that given everything they\'ve seen, little glimmers of hope, this futurist can\'t seem to see reason, before Frank explains that the sphere was Nix\'s idea (of which Frank helped to assemble it).\n\nNix\'s idea was reasonable: broadcast a future in which humanity would be galvanized to do something about what they believed would happen...but instead, all the visions did was make people accept what they saw, and give in. They repackaged what they saw into media, and seemed to care only for the here-and-now, never willing to consider what their actions could mean for the future.\n\nThe three are about to be put through the portal, when Frank activates the sphere\'s lift via the controls on Nix\'s watch. As the two struggle, Frank tells Athena to use the 1-kiloton device to blow up the sphere.\n\nHowever, Nix activates two robots, and Athena is detained. Tossing the device to Casey, she climbs onto the platform. She manages to arm the device, but during Frank\'s struggle, Nix manages to keep the platform from ascending. With the device armed, and no way up, Casey hurls the device through the portal, with Athena shutting it just before it explodes. However, the blast loosens a piece of architecture, and it crashes down on Nix\'s leg, pinning him to the ground.\n\nSuddenly, Athena sees Nix shoot Frank with a laser gun...only to see it was a tachyon glimpse of the future. Seeing the real thing unfold before her, she rushes into the line of fire, and takes the blast.\n\nFrank attempts to get Athena to a repair station, but she tells him she can\'t be repaired. As she begins to shut down, Athena reveals to Frank glimpses of her memory, via logs:\n\none tells of how she fears what will happen when he finds out she isn\'t human, but wishes to support him, as it seems she helps spur on his creativity. - another tells how she may be having emotions towards him, but has decided not to report this.\n\nthe final transmission, shows the year 1984, in which Frank was exiled from Tomorrowland, blaming Athena for what happened.\n\nAthena explains that she can still be of use to Frank: she has a self-destruct device within her, and she can be used to destroy the sphere. Using a jet pack, Frank ascends above the city with his former friend and confidante.\n\nAs she shuts down, Frank drops her into the sphere. Her self-destruct mechanism sends the sphere crashing to the ground, and crushing Governor Nix.\n\nOnce back on the ground, Casey and Frank wonder what to do next. It is soon decided there is only one thing to do: become proactive!\n\nCasey opens the portal near her home, and invites her father and brother into Tomorrowland.\n\nFrank decides to reopen the recruitment program, turning on the pin-making machines, and building a number of new child-looking recruiters.\n\nWe soon find that this is who Casey and Frank have been talking to the whole time: the new recruiters (like Athena). Each one is given their own pin-case, with a mission to find Dreamers, those that will help build a newer, and better Tomorrow.\n\nThe final images show a number of people finding the "T" pins. As they each touch them, we then see dozens of people popping up in the vast wheat field, eyes drawn towards the spires of Tomorrowland.']
['In the year 1996, Los Angeles has become a crime-ridden hell where street gangs control the city. The most powerful gang leader, Simon Phoenix, has set up the largest and most dangerous territory for himself, with his headquarters inside a large, dilapidated building. When he kidnaps about 30 passengers from a city bus, an LA supercop, John Spartan, whom has a reputation for destroying property while working on cases and a long history of reprimand by his superiors, is sent in to arrest Phoenix and rescue the hostages. Spartan bungee jumps onto the roof of Phoenix\' headquarters and fights his way through the structure, defeating several of Phoenix\' guards. When Phoenix sees Spartan\'s approach on his security cameras, he grabs a dagger and punctures several barrels of gasoline, spilling it onto the floor. Spartan arrives and orders Phoenix to reveal the location of the hostages. Phoenix catches Spartan off guard, showing him the pool of gas and brandishing a lit torch. He defiantly refuses to give up the hostages and flicks a lit cigarette toward Spartan, igniting the gas. Spartan grabs Phoenix and runs out of the building while the flames ignite several barrels of C4 explosive. The building collapses just after Spartan makes it to safety.\n\nWhen Spartan\'s captain shows up, he immediately chastises Spartan for destroying the building per his usual methods (hence, his nickname "The Demolition Man"), however Spartan tells him that Phoenix had deliberately rigged the place to explode. Spartan also tells his chief that he\'d done a thermal scan of the building and found only Phoenix and his goons there. Phoenix yells that Spartan was wrong and a fire chief suddenly informs them all that they\'ve found about 30 bodies in the rubble which can only be the bus passengers. Phoenix claims that he told Spartan about the hostages and that Spartan said he didn\'t care. Spartan\'s chief tells him to get a good lawyer. Spartan is charged with involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to a 70 year term in a new prison where the inmates are cryogenically frozen. During their incarceration, prisoners are subject to reconditioning to change their behavior.\n\nThirty-six years later in 2032, the prison is still in operation. Los Angeles has changed considerably, having become a community of peace. The cities of LA, Santa Barbara and San Diego have merged into one giant urban center after a giant earthquake devastated most of Southern California. The San Angeles Police Department hasn\'t dealt with a violent crime in over 16 years. The city is led by a seemingly benevolent man named Raymond Cocteau, who is responsible for the society LA has become.\n\nPhoenix finds himself unfrozen for a parole hearing. Though it\'s likely he\'ll simply be denied, he\'s given a chance to speak by Warden Smithers. Phoenix gives the password to unlock his shackles and attacks the guards and Smithers. To get past the prison\'s retinal scanners, he tears out the warden\'s eye. He steals a car and heads for Los Angeles.\n\nAt the SAPD\'s HQ, the police force are alerted by their central computer, L7, of a "Code 187" which they don\'t recognize but L7 identifies as "MurderDeathKill". The force is horrified to see that the warden and another doctor of the prison have been killed by Phoenix. They work quickly to locate him and find him on Wilshire Boulevard. At a control kiosk, Phoenix discovers that he has new abilities, such as increased strength, hand-to-hand combat skills and that he can hack the city\'s computer system. The officers sent to arrest him are no match and he quickly beats or kills them. He then detonates the batteries in one of their squad cars and escapes. Shocked at the level of violence, the SAPD, led by an officer named Lenina Huxley, decide they have to free John Spartan from his prison sentence to stop Phoenix.\n\nSpartan is thawed and reinstated to the police force. He is also told that his wife was killed in the big earthquake of 2010. His daughter\'s whereabouts are unknown. When he asks for a cigarette, he\'s told they and a list of foods and vices from the past are illegal because they are unhealthy. He\'s also told that he\'s had a microchip implanted in his hand so his location can be monitored at all time. Spartan objects immediately, criticizing the plan as fascist. He also scoffs at the police chief\'s theory that Phoenix will try to set up a new crime syndicate. Spartan knows that Phoenix\' immediate plan is to arm himself and continue his terrorist activities. When the chief tells him that the only guns left in the city limits are in a museum, Spartan and Huxley go there.\n\nIn the museum, Phoenix breaks open a display case and grabs several weapons, including a laser firing rifle. Trapped temporarily in the exhibit, Spartan finds Phoenix and the two battle in a vicious gunfight and hand-to-hand. Phoenix is able to escape through the museum\'s roof. He runs directly into Cocteau and tries to shoot him but is unable to pull the trigger. Cocteau tells Phoenix that he should be hunting a man named Edgar Friendly instead of wasting his time terrorizing San Angeles. Spartan catches up but Phoenix escapes again. Grateful that Spartan "saved" his life, Cocteau invites him and Huxley to dinner at Taco Bell, the only restaurant left in the area after and event called the Franchise Wars.\n\nAt dinner, Cocteau and his guests grill Spartan about his unruly methods and vulgar language. He takes most of the criticism as a compliment and makes mention of the fact that he was actually conscious during his incarceration and that he remembers seeing his wife outside his ice block. Cocteau dismisses Spartan\'s claims. Just then Spartan sees shady-looking people outside the restaurant and runs after them. He takes several of them down but stops when one of them begs him not to hurt him and drops a container of food his group had stolen from the restaurant. Huxley is over-excited, praising Spartan for his ability in hand-to-hand but Spartan scolds her saying that violence isn\'t the best solution and that the people he\'d roughed up were just trying to get something to eat.\n\nHuxley later takes Spartan to her apartment. Saying that the evening\'s violence has her sexually aroused, she politely asks if John will have sex with her. She places a helmet on his head which uses a form of sensory induction to stimulate their brains directly. John is appalled, preferring physical contact. Huxley explains that physical contact and "fluid exchange" are illegal because of sexually transmitted diseases that were worse than AIDS. She asks John to leave her apartment when John makes physical advances. John returns to his apartment and examines a video recording from the museum she\'d given him. He sees that Phoenix, when he\'d found Cocteau at the museum, had plenty of time to kill Cocteau but didn\'t. John grows more suspicious of San Angeles\' benefactor.\n\nThe next morning John apologizes to Huxley for his behavior. She forgives him and the two access L7\'s records on Phoenix, finding that he\'d been given a rehab program to turn him into an even more violent sociopath than he\'d been in 1996. Spartan has Huxley take him to Cocteau\'s offices where he confronts Cocteau directly, threatening to harm him. Cocteau is still able to conceal his secret: in a later secret meeting with Phoenix, he reveals that he\'d altered the villain\'s rehab program so he\'d murder Edgar Friendly and the rest of Friendly\'s mob, who live in the ruins under Los Angeles, where they are poor, starving and steal food. These "Scraps" are a constant annoyance to Cocteau, who wants them wiped out. Phoenix has a small demand of his own: in order to properly do the job, he wants a few of his fellow cryocons released. However, they will not undergo the same rehabilitation conditioning that Phoenix himself did, making them even more dangerous.\n\nSpartan figures out that the reason why the SAPD\'s manhunt didn\'t find Phoenix is because he\'d been hiding under the city. Phoenix meets with the cryocons that he\'d gotten Cocteau to release and tells them they have to kill Friendly and then the city will be theirs. Spartan and Huxley find Edgar Friendly, who tells them he\'s not a fan of Cocteau\'s dictatorship and would rather live his life in abject poverty but still be free. Spartan and Huxley are found by Phoenix and another battle ensues. Phoenix escapes to the surface and steals an SAPD squad car. Huxley & Spartan tear after him in an antique 1970 Oldsmobile 442. During the chase, Phoenix tells Spartan that he\'d already killed all the bus passengers in 1996. Phoenix escapes again and Spartan sees Friendly\'s mob approaching. They give him weapons to go after Phoenix. At Cocteau\'s office, Phoenix introduces him to his freed prisoner horde and has one of them murder Cocteau, throwing his body in the fireplace. Phoenix is granted access to the cryoprison and plans to thaw out more criminals, many of whom were incarcerated by Spartan and haven\'t undergone any reconditioning. Spartan goes after Phoenix at the cryoprison after using a stun rod on Huxley to keep her from joining him.\n\nAt the prison, Phoenix is finishing the last stages of freeing the prisoners. He kills all the technicians just as Spartan arrives. The two exchange gunfire and fight furiously until Spartan is able to freeze Phoenix. As he swings around on a large crane, he knocks Phoenix\' frozen head off, which shatters on the floor. Spartan runs out of the cryoprison as it explodes.\n\nHe meets Huxley and his chief outside. The inhabitants of San Angeles aren\'t sure of how to continue their lives since Cocteau is dead but Spartan assures them they\'ll be fine. He also looks forward to starting a new romantic relationship with Huxley.']
['Picking up shortly after the previous film, \'Insurgent\' left off, now that Jeanine is dead, Evelyn (Naomi Watts) has assumed control of Chicago and is placing everyone in Erudite that worked for Jeanine on trial, while also sealing off the gates to the rediscovered land outside the city.\n\nTris (Shailene Woodley) and Four (Theo James) watch as Max (Mekhi Pfeiffer) is the first to go on trial. Most of Evelyn\'s followers demand that Max be executed, while those that follow Johanna (Octavia Spencer) think he ought to be spared. Kang (Daniel Dae Kim) gives Max the Candor truth serum. Max shows no remorse for killing people under Jeanine\'s orders, and he compares people to sheep that get slaughtered if they stray from their shepherd. Evelyn listens to the people and has Edgar (Jonny Weston) shoot Max in the head. Caleb (Ansel Elgort) is on trial next, and he fears for what they\'ll do to him. Johanna is booed out with her followers for disagreeing with Evelyn\'s verdict.\n\nFour goes against his mother, saying there was no point in going to war with Jeanine when Evelyn just became her.\n\nTris and Four plot to break Caleb out. Four orders Evelyn\'s guards to release Caleb to him. Four takes him outside and throws him into a ditch before taking out his gun and pretending to shoot Caleb. The guards leave, and Caleb comes out of hiding.\n\nThe three of them, along with Christina (Zoe Kravitz) and Tori (Maggie Q) plot to break out of the city. Peter (Miles Teller) comes along so that he won\'t rat on the group. After fooling Evelyn\'s guards, the group heads toward the wall, but one of the guards alerts Edgar to their plan.\n\nAs the group reaches the wall, they shoot their grappling hooks and use the wires to scale the wall. However, the fence on top of the wall is electrified. Tris goes down the wall with Four following so she can destroy the electrical box. Edgar and his boys show up and start shooting at the group. Four holds them off as Tris places a bomb on the box. As they run back to the wall, she detonates it, blowing up the box and killing some of the goons. Tris and Four run back up the wall. Tori is shot and killed by Edgar, and Tris is forced to leave her behind.\n\nOnce they make it further away from the city, they discover that the land has been mostly burnt out and become a toxic wasteland. The rain that falls on them is red. A van rolls in above the group... it\'s Edgar. They run for it and reach a point where a wall to another city appears to open up, revealing vans and aircraft. A squad of soldiers take the group in and blast Edgar\'s van away.\n\nThe group is taken in plasma bubbles to a facility known as the Bureau of Genetic Welfare. They are decontaminated and have a bar code printed onto their skin, but all with different coding. A video shows the group an explanation of what happened to the world. Many generations ago, a hopeful miracle drug was created, but it naturally spun out of control and led to chaos around the globe, leading the survivors to form the Bureau and strive to fix things.\n\nTris is taken to meet the Bureau\'s director David (Jeff Daniels). He considers Tris a miracle, as she is what the Bureau considers "pure", while the others, like Caleb and Four, are "damaged." David has also been watching everything that goes on around the city, which explains how he knows Tris and what she\'s been through, as well as everything that is happening in the city now. David gives Tris a device that allows her to see the memories of her late mother Natalie (Ashley Judd) from when she was a child living in The Fringe, the isolated area where the infected roam and attack survivors. Natalie was saved and later worked with David to establish the Faction system.\n\nFour is assigned to a woman named Nita (Nadia Hilker), who teaches him how to use target drones for combat. Peter and Caleb are put on surveillance duty to observe what goes on around the city.\n\nCaleb observes Evelyn and her henchmen meeting with Johanna and a few of her followers, which have called themselves the Allegiant. The two leaders are prepared for a war, which is instigated by Edgar after he shoots one of Johanna\'s followers.\n\nFour is on duty with the other men on his team. They go into The Fringe and accidentally kill the father of a young boy. The boy and other survivors are brought in and supposedly decontaminated with a special gas. However, Christina notes to Four that the boy has forgotten his father and his own name.\n\nDavid takes Tris to Providence, a clean and dystopic city structure where all the privileged folks live. Tris appears before a council to go along with David\'s plan to cleanse the world, but she rejects the notion that they should classify some as pure and others as damaged.\n\nFour is apparently sent to The Fringe with one Bureau worker, Matthew (Bill Skarsgard). However, Matthew tips Four off about the Bureau\'s true intentions. He fights the goons on board and crashes the ship. Four escapes and tells Matthew to tell Tris and David that Four left him behind, because Tris will know that\'s a lie. Four is eventually captured and taken back into the city.\n\nDavid sends Peter back into the city to deliver the gas to Evelyn, claiming that David is a personal friend. Peter suggests using it on the Allegiant so that Evelyn may retain control over everyone. She tests it out on her ex-husband Marcus (Ray Stevenson). With a heavy dose, Marcus literally watches his mind deteriorate and his memories disappear, leaving him with no idea who Evelyn is or was to him.\n\nKnowing that something bad is gonna happen, Tris steals David\'s hovercraft and gets Caleb and Christina to head back into the city. Nita gives them some weapons because she hates David too. The three fly away and are pursued by David\'s henchmen. They try to bring Tris down gently, but she attempts to manually fly the ship, nearly crashing it until they are able to go beyond the camouflage wall.\n\nTris and Christina make it into Evelyn\'s facility where she plans to release the gas unto the Allegiant, unaware that it will go throughout the entire city. Tris reunites with Four while Caleb is outside on surveillance. Evelyn begins to release the gas until Four tells her that it will affect both of them, and he won\'t know who his mother is. She has a change of heart and tries to stop it, but Peter shoots her in the back and allows it to continue, until the gas reaches the room he\'s in. He frantically tries to stop it but can\'t.\n\nThe gas starts spreading into the city, hitting some of the Allegiant. Tris runs down to the main control room, but David, who is still watching, tries to hold her off. Tris uses the drones to find the main power grid for the gas and blasts through the wall to ultimately destroy it. David yells in defeat while the gas stops spreading.\n\nTris sends a message to everyone in the city, saying that they are neither pure nor damaged, but that they must stand united as one city against their oppressors. Tris leans against Four, thinking everything is fine... not knowing David is still watching and planning something sinister.']
['In the year 2274, the remnants of human civilization live in a sealed city contained beneath a cluster of geodesic domes, a utopia run by a computer that takes care of all aspects of life, including reproduction. The citizens live a hedonistic lifestyle but, to prevent overpopulation, everyone must undergo the rite of "Carrousel" when they reach the age of 30. There, they are killed under the guise of being "renewed".\n\nTo track this, each person is implanted at birth with a "life-clock" crystal in the palm of the hand that changes color as they get older and begins blinking as they approach their "Last Day." Most residents accept this chance for rebirth, but those who do not and attempt to flee the city are known as "Runners". An elite team of policemen known as "Sandmen", outfitted in predominantly black uniforms and serving in an agency of the city called "Deep Sleep", are assigned to pursue and terminate Runners as they try to escape.\n\nLogan 5 and Francis 7 are both Sandmen. After terminating a Runner, to whose presence they were alerted during a Carrousel rite, Logan finds an ankh among his possessions. Later that evening, he meets Jessica 6, a young woman also wearing an ankh pendant. Logan takes the ankh to the computer, which tells him that it is a symbol for a secret group whose members help the Runners find "Sanctuary", a mythic place where they will be safe to live out the rest of their lives.\n\nLogan learns that the Sandmen have lost 1,056 Runners this way. The computer instructs Logan to find Sanctuary and destroy it, a mission which it code names "Procedure 033-03", which he must keep secret from the other Sandmen of Deep Sleep. Then, by a procedure it calls "retrogram", the computer changes the color of his life clock to flashing red, suddenly making him four years closer to Carrousel. Scared, he asks if the four years will be restored to him when his mission is completed but receives no response. In order to escape this, Logan is now forced to become a Runner. Logan meets Jessica and explains his situation. They meet with the underground group that leads them to the periphery of the city.\n\nLogan learns that the ankh symbol is actually a key that unlocks an exit from the city. They come out into a frozen cave, with Francis following closely behind. In the cave, they meet Box, a robot designed to capture food for the city from the outside. Logan discovers, to his horror, that Box also captures escaped Runners and freezes them for food. Before Box can freeze Logan and Jessica, they escape, causing the cave to collapse on the robot.\n\nOnce outside, Logan and Jessica notice that their life clocks are no longer operational. They see the Sun for the first time and discover that the remains of human civilization have become a wilderness. They explore an old, seemingly abandoned city which was once Washington, D.C. In the ruins of the United States Senate chamber, they discover an elderly man living with many cats. His appearance is a shock to them, since neither has ever seen anyone over the age of thirty. The old man recounts what he remembers about what happened to humanity outside the city, and Logan realizes that Sanctuary has always been a myth.\n\nHowever, Francis has followed them and he and Logan fight. Logan fatally wounds Francis; as he dies, Francis sees that Logan\'s life clock is now clear and assumes Logan has renewed. Logan and Jessica persuade the old man to return to the city with them as proof that life exists outside the domed city. Leaving the man outside, the two enter and try to convince everyone that Carrousel is a lie and unnecessary. The two are captured by other Sandmen and taken to the computer, which interrogates Logan about Procedure 033-03 and asks if he completed his mission.\n\nLogan insists, "There is no Sanctuary". What he had found was "old ruins, exposed", "an old man", and that the missing Runners were "all frozen". These answers are not accepted by the computer, even after scanning Logan\'s mind, and the computer overloads, causing the city\'s systems to fail violently and release the exterior seals. Logan, Jessica, and the other citizens flee the ruined city. Once outside, the citizens see the old man, the first human they have met who is older than thirty, proving that they can, indeed, live their lives much longer.']
['This movie takes place in three interweaving narratives that encompass the age of the Spanish conquistadors, the near-future period and a journey through deep space in an ecospheric starship.\n\nThe scientist: Research oncologist Tommy Creo (Hugh Jackman) attempts to reverse brain tumors in rhesus monkeys through animal testing. His work is motivated by his cancer-stricken wife Izzi (Rachel Weisz). When the tests fail on a monkey named Donovan, Tommy is inspired to break medical protocol and use an untested compound derived from a Guatemalan tree. At first, the drug fails to stop the tumor\'s growth, but surprisingly rejuvenates Donovan, healing his wounds and improving his cognitive abilities.\n\nAt home, Izzi points out a golden nebula to Tommy, describing it as Xibalba, the Mayan underworld. She also shows Tommy a book she is writing, set in the age of conquistadors, titled The Fountain. When she goes to sleep, Tommy reads the book and falls asleep as well. When he wakes up, he finds that Izzi has gone to the museum. He meets her there, and she explains the creation myth of the Mayans. She suddenly collapses from a seizure and is rushed to the hospital. She tells Tommy, at her bedside, that she no longer fears death. Tommy does not accept this and returns to his lab, working harder to find a cure for Izzi\'s brain tumor.\n\nDuring a visit, Izzi goes into cardiac arrest, and Tommy is forced to leave the room. Tommy\'s associate Dr. Lillian Guzetti (Ellen Burstyn) finds him in the hall and tells him that Donovan\'s tumor is shrinking. Tommy rushes back into Izzi\'s room with the news, only to find that his wife cannot be resuscitated. At Izzi\'s funeral, Tommy tells Guzetti, "Death is a disease, it\'s like any other. And there is a cure. A cure. And I will find it."\n\nThe Conquistador: In 16th century Spain, Grand Inquisitor Silecio (Stephen McHattie) demonizes the Spanish Queen Isabella (Rachel Weisz) as a heretic. He slowly acquires territories as part of his plan to take Spain from her, killing her followers along the way. Tomas (Hugh Jackman), a conquistador in the service of Isabella, plots to assassinate Silecio, only to be stopped by a subordinate, Captain Ariel (Cliff Curtis), bearing an urgent message from the Queen. Returning to Isabella\'s court, Tomas is given the mission of finding the Tree of Life. The tree\'s location is revealed on a hidden map displayed by a Mayan dagger stolen by Father Avila (Mark Margolis), whose Franciscan order backs the Queen.\n\nTomas journeys to the New World (America) with Avila and fellow conquistadores to find the tree. As the search drags on and the hardships of the quest multiply, the men mutiny; Tomas restores order by killing the ringleaders as Avila reveals that they have arrived at their destination. As Tomas approaches the pyramid atop which the tree grows, Mayan warriors attack the conquistadores. Tomas\'s last two men are killed fleeing the battle. Tomas is spared by the warriors, who force him to climb the pyramid. When Tomas reaches the temple at the top, he is stabbed in the abdomen by a Mayan priest.\n\nThe Astronaut: The astronaut, Tom (Hugh Jackman), travels toward a golden nebula in an ecospheric spacecraft, which also houses a living tree. Tom meditates in padmasana and practices tai chi. Kept young by compounds he produces from the tree\'s sap, Tom is haunted by visions of Izzi. He focuses on reaching the nebula, repeatedly assuring the tree that it will be reborn on arrival despite the amount of sap he has taken from it. Despite his assurance, the tree dies, leaving Tom to ponder the hundreds of years of travel that have been all to see Izzi again. Izzi haunts Tom in a vision and encourages him to finish writing her book, The Fountain. Tom faces his fear of death and accepts dying, allowing him to finally write the book\'s ending.\n\nResolution:\nInstead of killing Tomas, a Mayan priest identifies Tomas as First Father, the deity who sacrificed himself to create the world. The Mayan priest in turn presents himself as a sacrifice, and Tomas hesitatingly slits his throat. Passing through a doorway, the conquistador finds the Tree of Life in a garden atop the pyramid. As he pierces it with the stolen Mayan dagger, its sap spills onto the ground, and a small plant instantly grows and blossoms where it fell. Taking this as a sign of rejuvenation, Tomas applies some sap to his abdominal wound, healing himself. He then greedily drinks the sap, stopping only when he begins to see Xibalba appear above him. His victory is cut short however, as he collapses in pain, leaves and flowers bursting from his body, burying him. The future Tom is then shown passing into the heart of the nebula, wearing a ring given to Tomas by the Queen of Spain, and entering Xibalba at peace with the thought of his imminent death. As Xibalba collapses and supernovas Tom\'s body is scattered into the dead tree rejuvenating it. In the present day Tommy is seen planting a tree seed over Izzi\'s grave doing his best to accept his wife\'s death.']

['David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) are twins and attend the same high school. Jennifer is concerned mainly with her appearance, relationships and popularity, while David watches a lot of television, has few friends, and is socially awkward. Their mother (Jane Kaczmarek) leaves Jennifer and David alone at home while she heads out of town for a rendezvous with her younger boyfriend. The twins begin to fight over the use of the downstairs TV; Jennifer wants to watch an MTV concert with her date, Mark Davis, while David hopes to watch a marathon of his favorite show, Pleasantville.\n\nPleasantville is a black-and-white \'50s sitcom, a cross between Leave It to Beaver and Father Knows Best that centers around the idyllic Parker family George (William H. Macy), his wife Betty (Joan Allen), and their two children, Bud and Mary Sue. David is an expert on every episode and wants to watch the marathon so he can win a $1,000 trivia contest. During the fight between David and Jennifer, the remote control breaks and the TV cannot be turned on manually. A mysterious TV repairman (Don Knotts) shows up uninvited, and quizzes David on Pleasantville before giving him a strange-looking, retro-styled remote control. The repairman leaves, and David and Jennifer promptly resume fighting. However, through some mechanism of the remote control, they are transported into the television, ending up in the Parkers\' black and white Pleasantville living room. David tries to reason with the repairman (who communicates with him through the Parkers\' TV set) but succeeds only in chasing him away. David and Jennifer must now pretend they are, respectively, Bud and Mary Sue Parker.\n\nJennifer is dismayed to be stranded, but she and David begin exposing the town to issues such as sex, personal freedoms, styles of art, and literature. Pleasantville soon begins changing at a rapid pace, and previously black and white objects and people begin to develop full and vibrant colors. After initially wanting to leave, David discovers a sense of belonging he lacked in the real world, so when the TV repairman returns and berates him for altering the show so much, David turns off the TV, relinquishing his ability to go home in the process. While the mayor is concerned, people in Pleasantville begin to explore hidden abilities and revel in their new freedoms.\n\nThe town fathers, who see the changes as eating away at the town\'s moral values, remain unchanged. Certain youths, such as Skip and Whitey and their friends, also remain unaffected. They resolve to do something about their increasingly distant wives and disaffected youths. Behavior similar to Nazism, as well as racial segregation and subsequent rioting similar to that of the African-American Civil Rights Movement start to occur, incited by a nude painting of Betty on the window of Bud\'s boss Bill Johnsons soda shop; the window is smashed with a park bench, and the soda shop is destroyed, books are burned, and anyone who is "colored" is harassed in the streets. Bud begins to grow into a strong leader, advocating resistance to the new "Pleasantville Code of Conduct", a list of regulations preventing people from visiting the library and Lovers\' Lane, playing loud music, or using colorful paints. Bud/David and Bill are arrested and tried in court for violating the paint rules, but ultimately everyone in the court room changes colors and Mayor Bob leaves in horror when he is exposed as having changed as well.\n\nEventually, the entire town becomes colored, and the people of Pleasantville are finally introduced to the rest of the world. Televisions at the television repair shop now display full-colored images of various scenic vistas around the world, and Main Street, which had previously been a circuit that led back to its beginning again, now leads away to other towns and cities.\n\nJennifer chooses to stay behind in neighboring Springfield, while says goodbye to Betty and his new girlfriend David returns home using the remote control after promising to return and check up on her soon. He finds his mother crying in the kitchen, distraught over her life and her failed relationship. She complains to him that her life was not supposed to run this undesirable course. David replies, "It\'s not \'supposed\' to be \'anything\'."\n\nBack in Pleasantville, the citizens and Jennifer are enjoying their new freedoms and colors. Betty is seen sitting next to George on a park bench. George asks what will happen next and Betty admits incredulously that she doesn\'t know. When she asks George, he laughs upon realizing that he doesn\'t know either. The camera focuses on Betty for a second as she relaxes against the bench, then she turns once more toward the other side of the bench. The camera pans to the side to reveal Bill Johnson sitting where George had been. He says "I guess I don\'t know either," and smiles.']
['This film is set in an alternate reality of the city of Los Angeles, where humans co-exist with orcs, elves, and fairies. Officer Daryl Ward (Will Smith) is out on the streets with his partner, Nick Jakoby (Joel Edgerton), who is the world\'s first orc cop. Jakoby is grabbing a burrito when an orc gangster emerges from a shop and blasts Ward with a shotgun.\n\nSome time later, Ward is ready to go back to the force. He is struggling to keep his house that he shares with his wife Sherri (Dawn Olivieri) and daughter Sophia (Scarlet Spencer). Sophia hates that her dad is a cop because she worries he\'ll get killed. They see a video from Joe Rogan interviewing an orc as they discuss Jakoby being on the force. The other orcs hate Jakoby as they consider him a traitor. Ward dislikes having him as a partner because he blames Jakoby for him getting shot. Sherri then makes him go outside to deal with a fairy that\'s attacking the bird feeder. Ward takes a broom and whacks the fairy to death.\n\nWard and Jakoby ride together, with Ward openly blaming Jakoby for the shooting incident. After driving through the wealthy Elftown neighborhood, they arrive at work, where a few rotten cops - Pollard (Ike Barinholtz), Hicks (Matt Gerald), and Brown (Joseph Piccuirro) - mock Jakoby when he\'s not around. When Ward is assigned to be on patrol with Jakoby for the day, he protests to Sergeant Ching (Margaret Cho), but she doesn\'t care for his complaints.\n\nWard and Jakoby head downtown to handle a disturbance, meeting with Sheriff Rodriguez (Jay Hernandez). A crazy man named Serling (Chris Browning) is waving a sword around and yelling nonsense. With the officers drawing their weapons, Serling surrenders and is taken into custody. On the ride back to the precinct, Serling pukes in the back of the car before starting to speak Orkish to Jakoby, saying he has a message from an organization called the Shield of Light, telling him to "remember the old ways", and how a prophecy has chosen him, and that Ward is blessed.\n\nWard is later approached by Captain Perez (Andrea Navedo), along with two men - Yamahara (Kenneth Choi) and Arkashian (Bobby Naderi) - who order Ward to record Jakoby admitting that he let Ward\'s shooter get away.\n\nSerling is interrogated by an elf FBI agent, Kandomere (Edgar Ramirez), and his partner Montehugh (Happy Anderson). The agents ask Serling what he knows about two elf sisters - Leilah (Noomi Rapace) and Tikka (Lucy Fry). Serling knows that Leilah is a dark elf, part of the Inferni clan that wants to resurrect the Dark Lord, an evil entity that was defeated 2,000 years earlier by the Nine Armies. Leilah and her minions want to bring him back to unleash darkness upon the world with the use of three magic wands. Leilah is a "Bright", meaning she can wield a wand without it destroying her. Montehugh says they need to find Tikka in order to set a trap for Leilah.\n\nOn the night patrol, Ward tries to get Jakoby to confess to the incident, when they are alerted to something going on at a house on Abrams Street. They arrive and are shot at by an unseen assailant. After a shootout, the officers kill the assailant. They head inside the house and find dead bodies, including a few that look like they were burnt alive. The officers find Tikka, who is in possession of the wand.\n\nWard calls in Ching and the other cops in regards to the wand. They want the wand for themselves, and they order Ward to go along with it and kill Jakoby, or he dies as well. Ward goes outside to do the job, but first he presses Jakoby at gunpoint on what really happened when he got shot. Jakoby admits he did let the shooter get away, but it was because he lost him in a crowd. He thought he cornered the guy in an alley, but it was just a young orc spray-painting the side of a building. Knowing that the human officers would kill the kid on the spot, Jakoby let him get away on a fire escape. Moments later, Ching and the officers step outside. Ward spins around quickly and shoots them all dead, but Pollard is the only one hanging on for his life. Jakoby attempts to arrest Ward until they are approached by a gang led by wheelchair-bound Poison (Enrique Murciano), who knows about the wand and wants it for himself so that he can walk again. Ward and Jakoby take Tikka and head into their van as the gangsters start attacking.\n\nThe officers drive away as the gangsters pursue them. The gangsters shoot at them, but Ward and Jakoby are able to shake most of them off. They find a place to hide briefly until more gangsters come after them. One of them finds the wand and tries to grab it, but it causes him to explode and kill those around him.\n\nLeilah and her minions arrive at the Abrams house and find Pollard dying before Leilah finishes the job. She then finds another Inferni elf, Larika (Nadia Grey), who is stuck to the walls. She tells Leilah that Tikka got away with the wand, and she slashes Larika\'s throat. The elves then come across a family that they kill for more information on the wand\'s whereabouts. Kandomere and Montehugh later come upon the crime scene at the Abrams house, and Kandomere knows Leilah has lost the wand, making her vulnerable.\n\nWard, Jakoby, and Tikka walk through a sleazy orc/human strip club. Poison and his gang find them and once again threaten them for the wand, but Leilah and her minions show up and slaughter Poison and his gang. Another shootout happens, forcing the trio to run again. They run into a nearby convenience store where they find a place to hide. While tending to their wounds in a bathroom, Ward and Jakoby discuss their relationship. Although Ward doesn\'t think of them as friends, he does tell Jakoby that he shouldn\'t want to be like him, despite Jakoby previously stating he wishes he were because he sees Ward as fearless.\n\nRodriguez shows up to the store after hearing about Ward killing the officers. He orders Ward to cuff Jakoby since everyone suspects him anyway, and Jakoby willingly relents. Rodriguez is then shot dead as the elves drive up and crash through the store, shooting at the cops. The trio fight back, shooting at the elves before getting away.\n\nThe trio are then found by a group of orc gangsters belonging to the Fogteeth clan. After Ward mocks them, they get beaten and dragged to a church that serves as their lair. The orcs bring them to their leader, Dorghu (Brad William Henke). He wants the wand as well, and he mocks Jakoby for being unblooded (accepted by the other orcs as one of their own). After the cops refuse to give up the wand, Dorghu orders them to be executed. The guards drag Ward and Jakoby to a pit, and Dorghu orders his son Mikey (Brandon Larracuente) to execute Jakoby. However, Mikey can\'t bring himself to do so, because he is the young orc that Jakoby let get away. Dorghu allows Mikey to go home, and Dorghu shoots Jakoby, letting his body fall into the pit. Tikka then pulls out the wand and uses it to resurrect Jakoby and raise his body up. The other orcs are astonished and kneel before Jakoby, believing him to be the one the prophecy spoke of. The three then leave.\n\nTikka then speaks English for the first time, now that she knows she can trust Ward and Jakoby. She explains that she took the wand because she knew Leilah wanted to bring back the Dark Lord, and she had sent Larika to kill her, but Tikka took the wand herself. The use of the wand took a toll on her, and it\'s starting to kill her. She tells them that the Shield of Light can help them if they take her to a pool back at the Abrams house.\n\nWard and Jakoby bring Leilah back to the house. Leilah and the other dark elves show up and battle the cops. Ward and Jakoby manage to kill the elves, and Jakoby appears to shoot Leilah dead. They then take Tikka to the pool beneath a tree, but Leilah emerges, still alive. When she tries to get the wand, Ward grabs it himself. It starts to glow, and he doesn\'t explode, meaning he is a Bright. Tikka tells him a war word to cast a spell, which Ward repeats, causing the wand to blast Leilah to smithereens. Outside, authorities arrive just as they witness the explosion. Ward and Jakoby look for Tikka, but she\'s gone.\n\nThe officers are in the hospital and are approached by Kandomere and Montehugh. Although Jakoby tries to explain everything that happened, Ward denies that there was ever a wand, and that gangsters killed the corrupt officers.\n\nIn the final scene, Ward and Jakoby are commemorated for their heroism. Pollard, Brown, Hicks, and Ching are also honored alongside Rodriguez, with Ward expressing his hatred for that fact. Jakoby tells him to let it go, since at least they know the truth. Sherri and Sophia are there to support Ward, while he and Jakoby notice Tikka walking among the crowd, smiling at them.']

['In the distant future, the human race has been assimilated by extraterrestrial, non-coporial, psychic parasites called "Souls". The Souls travel to distant planets en masse, in individual capsules, inserting themselves individually into a host body of that planet\'s dominant species. The Soul completely replaces the consciousness of its host, though they are able to access the host\'s memories. Occupied hosts are identifiable by silver rings that form in the hosts\' eyes.\n\nA teenager named Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) is captured and infused with a soul called "Wanderer". Wanderer is asked by the Seeker (Diane Kruger) to access Melanie\'s memories in order to discover the location of a pocket of non-assimilated humans. Surprisingly, Melanie\'s consciousness has not been eliminated, and it struggles for control of her body. Melanie and Wanderer are able to carry out an internal conversation with each other, forming something of a friendship.\n\nWanderer does share with the Seeker that Melanie was traveling with her younger brother, Jamie (Chandler Canterbury) and her boyfriend, Jared Howe (Max Irons), to find Melanie\'s uncle Jeb (William Hurt) in the desert. Wanderer admits that Melanie is still present, so Seeker decides to be transferred into Melanie\'s body to get the information herself. With the help of Melanie, Wanderer escapes from the city and makes her way to the desert, where she is eventually found by Jeb, who takes her to a series of caves hidden inside a mountain, where the pocket of humans (including Jared and Jamie) is hiding.\n\nWanderer\'s presence in the shelter is met with hostility by all but Jeb. Seeing this, Melanie instructs Wanderer not to tell anyone she is still alive, fearing that doing so would only provoke them, though she later allows her to tell Jamie, to put his mind at ease. Wanderer begins interacting with the humans and participating in their harvest, and slowly begins to gain their trust, as well as forming a bond with human Ian O\'Shea (Jake Abel). Through this, she begins to sympathize with them, and question her species\' actions.\n\nMeanwhile, the Seeker leads a search party into the desert to find Wanderer. They intercept one of the shelter\'s supply teams, and in the ensuing chase, two of the human resistance fighters, Aaron and Brandt, commit suicide to avoid capture and conversion. During the chase, Seeker accidentally kills another Soul, leading her superiors to call off the search for Wanderer.\n\nReturning to the caves, a vengeful Jared and Kyle move to kill Wanderer, causing Jamie to reveal that Melanie\'s consciousness is still alive. Ian accepts this, showing concern for the two beings in one body. Jared refuses to believe him, but, after having a dream about Melanie, attempts to determine the truth by kissing Wanderer, provoking Melanie to slap him away, and he realises that she is indeed still alive. Kyle makes another attempt on Wanderer\'s life, but she knocks him into a deadly whirlpool. She pulls him to safety and does not tell the others that he had attacked her. Ian believes that Kyle had attacked Wanderer and tells her that he loves her, insisting that Wanderer\'s own personality (such as protecting Kyle) is what he loves, rather than Melanie\'s body. Wanderer admits that, while occupying Melanie\'s body, she must love Jared, but that she has feelings of her own, and the two share a kiss, creating an unusual love trianglethree bodies and four minds.\n\nSometime later, Wanderer enters the community\'s medical facility, and discovers that Doc has been experimenting with ways to remove Souls and allow the host\'s mind to regain control, resulting in the deaths many Souls and Hosts from his failed experiments. Traumatized, she rushes from the facility, screaming at a protesting Melanie to "get out of my head!" After isolating herself for several days, Wanderer learns that Jamie is critically ill with a high fever and infection in his leg due to injuring himself with a knife. She infiltrates a Soul medical facility to steal some of their alien medicine, saving Jamie\'s life.\n\nThe Seeker has continued looking for Wanderer on her own. Jeb captures Seeker and imprisons her in the caves. Wanderer offers to show Doc the proper method of removing Souls, on the condition that he remove her from Melanie\'s body and let her die. Doc uses the technique to successfully remove Seeker from her host, with Host and Soul both surviving. Wanderer takes the Seeker alien to a Soul space-travel site, where she sends it to a planet far enough from Earth that it can not return within anyone\'s lifetime. The plan is to continue freeing hosts and sending the souls to distant planets.\n\nAfter learning that Wanderer wants to die when she is removed, the humans are upset. On the operating table, Melanie and Wanderer share an emotional farewell. But, due to the intervention of the rest of the group, Doc instead inserts Wanderer into Pet (Emily Browning), a human who was left brain-dead after the Soul inside her was removed, thereby ensuring that Wanderer can live without harming a human. Pet is said to be petite and small, with a face "that no one could mistrust." Now with a body of her own, she and Ian form a relationship, while Melanie is finally reunited with Jared.\n\nA few months later, while on a supply-gathering trip, Wanderer, Melanie, Ian and Jared are captured. They discover that their captors are actually humans, who reveal that there are several other human groups as well. The also learn that there is a Soul with this group that has sided with the flourishing human resistance, as Wanderer has, and they may not be the last Souls to do so.']
['The movie opens with a man walking down the street having just left a building in late-Victorian era London. It\'s wintertime, and the man pulls his coat around himself and hurries across the street. He knocks on the door of a house there, and a woman in late middle age lets him in. There he joins three other men who are sitting around the fire. The man\'s name is David Filby, and he and the three other men have been invited to dinner by George, who owns the house. He asked them to come over at 8:00 p.m., and it\'s just now 8, but George himself has yet to arrive. The date is January 5, 1900. The men are clearly unhappy about being kept waiting. A moment after 8, the woman, whose name is Mrs. Watchett, George\'s maid, enters the room and passes Filby a note. She tells them that George has been missing for several days. The note says that George thought he might be late, and if he was, then she should serve dinner and they could start without him.\n\nThey enter the dining room and sit down with their drinks, still complaining about George\'s absence. The door opens just then and George is there, looking very dishevelled, with noticeable cuts and bruises and torn clothes. He made it only a few minutes late. All the men, plus Mrs. Watchett, are concerned for his welfare, but he insists that he is OK, and he has "all the time in the world". He begins to tell the story of what happened to him. It begins five days earlier, on the night of December 31, 1899, when George and his four friends had been together in the same house, in the parlor that the men had left minutes earlier.\n\nOn that evening, George had told them about his experiments, how it was easy to move through the three spatial dimensions, but man had yet to figure out a way to travel through the fourth dimension, time. George hoped to invent a way to do so. He had spent two years working on a device to do so. His friends remain skeptical of his claim. He asks them to witness a demonstration of a small scale model. He opens a box on the table to reveal a machine, which he can hold comfortably in his hands, consisting of a seat, a control panel with a switch in front, and a rotating disk in back, surrounded by a brass railing. His friends think he might be a little nutty when he tells them how it can move not through space, but through time. George borrows a cigar from one of his friends, and bends it and puts it in the little model\'s seat to represent the man who is time traveling, then, using one of his friends\' fingers, pushes the switch forward. The disk on the back starts to rotate, and in a few seconds, the machine fades and vanishes from sight. It is gone into the future, never to return.\n\nGeorge\'s friends look around for the machine, at first thinking that he had performed a conjuring trick and the machine was simply somewhere else now, but George insists that it had not moved in space, but in time. The machine was still in exactly the same space on the table, but could be far in the future when the table upon which it stood or even the entire house might not exist any more. While George\'s friends are discussing what they have witnessed, George expounds on his theories and states his intention to take a time trip himself. His friends are concerned, wondering if George\'s inventing skills might be better put to use advancing the interests of his home country, Great Britain. The Boer War is going badly and the War Office might need some help. Still pondering what has been demonstrated, George\'s friends leave the house, wishing him a happy new century.\n\nGeorge returns inside and discovers that one of his friends, David Filby, is still there. Filby tells him that he was still worried that George had been behaving oddly and had changed a lot. George tells him he is preoccupied with time because he is unhappy with the time he lives in, with its constant wars and strife. Filby initially thinks that George intends to travel to the past, but George says he prefers the future. Filby can think of all that the machine could do, and implores George to destroy it because the technology is so dangerous. He invites him to come and spend New Years with him, but George declines, saying he\'d rather spend New Years alone. Filby asks George to promise him he won\'t leave the house tonight, and George promises he won\'t walk out the door. Then he invites Filby to come and bring the others over for dinner on Friday, January 5, 1900, five days hence. Filby leaves and George writes the note that he would read five days later. It\'s about 6:30 p.m. He wishes Mrs. Watchett a good night and then hurries off to his laboratory.\n\nThere is another time machine there, only this one is full-sized, big enough for George to climb into. George examines it for a short time, removes the glass-knobbed control lever for a little tinkering. He lights a candle in the corner and works on the handle for a moment, then returns to the machine and climbs in. Turning on the power switches, he looks down at the control panel which shows today\'s date, December 31, 1899. He nudges the handle forward slightly, and the disk behind him begins to rotate. After a few seconds, he pulls the handle back to the neutral position and looks around. Nothing seems to have changed, until he notices the clock in the corner. It was after 8 p.m., and the candle he had lit was several inches shorter. Checking his pocket watch, which had been with him in the device, he saw that it still showed only a little after 6:30 p.m.\n\nGeorge pushes the handle forward again a little further this time, and this time he watches time pass. As he watches, the candle burns down and goes out. The hands on the clock spin around. The sun comes up and moves rapidly across the sky. A snail races across the floor. Flowers open and close with the daylight. The sun goes down and comes up again, all in the time he perceives, inside the time machine, as only a few seconds. He sees people across the street at Filby\'s department store and sees the female dummy in the window. George notes that he is still traveling slowly and pushes the handle forward a little more, and the time progression outside the machine accelerates. Days pass by rapidly, and George improves his handling of the machine. He slows the machine down in the summer of 1900, and the alternating daylight and darkness slows, George looks across the street and sees the dummy in the department store window dressed differently. Bemused by the changing fashions, George continues to watch the clothes on the dummy change as he continues his journey into the future. Going faster, George watches the seasons change outside his windows instead of just days and nights. He was into the 1910s now. Suddenly, the light was gone - the windows had been boarded up. George brought the machine to a stop in September 1917, and got out to investigate.\n\nHis laboratory was dirty and filled with cobwebs, and entering the rest of the house, he found it in the same condition. It had been abandoned for an indeterminate amount of time. All the furniture was covered in drop cloths, and these were covered in a thick layer of dust. All the clocks in the parlor were silent, since no one was there to wind them or set them. A mouse skittered across the floor. George walks outside, after kicking aside the boards that were covering his door, to see the outside of the house abandoned and neglected, too. A wooden fence had been erected around the house. George went through it and crossed the street, walking towards Filby\'s store, which was still there. He saw an early automobile, something he\'d never seen before in his own time. A man wearing a soldier\'s uniform got out, and George recognized his friend Filby! Delighted, George began to speak to him. When George mentions Filby\'s lack of a mustache, Filby realizes that George has confused him with his father. This man is James Filby, who was the infant son of David Filby in George\'s time. David Filby had been killed in the The Great War (World War I) which George knew nothing about. George asks James Filby about the house across the street (his own house) and James tells him that the guy who owned it had disappeared around the turn of the century. It had fallen into David Filby\'s hands, who refused to sell it, thinking that George might return to claim it some day. The house had acquired a reputation as being haunted. George is dejected and realizes he\'s out of place, and makes his goodbyes and returns to his own house. He stops outside to pull some of the boards off his laboratory window so he can continue to watch the dummy in the store window.\n\nGeorge returns to the machine, gets in, and heads into the future once more. The house is still neglected and the windows break. He watches the dummy in the window as he speeds through the 1920s and 1930s. Then, in 1940, the room starts to shake. Thinking the machine might be malfunctioning, George brings it to a stop in June 1940, only to discover that the disturbance came from outside. There are airplanes outside (something else he\'d never seen before) dropping bombs with anti-aircraft guns shooting at them and fires burning in the distance. He realized that this was a new war, and he pressed on into the future to see how it went. Shortly afterward, his laboratory caught fire and disappeared. His house had been destroyed by a German bomb, and George was out in the open, safe within the time machine. He continues through the 1940s and watches as construction workers build a new large building not too far away. The fashions on the dummy in the window continue to change.\n\nGeorge hears a strange sound and brings the machine to a stop once more, this time in August of 1966. The sounds were air-raid sirens. He gets out of the machine and looks around. The ground that his house once stood on now looks like an urban park. Men and women walk through it in a hurry, urged by men in uniforms to get into the air-raid shelters. He looked out at the street, seeing many skyscrapers in the distance, and Filby\'s store had expanded to fill a whole block, with a substantial building of its own. Baffled by the commotion, George reads a plaque he finds in the park: "This park is dedicated by James Filby to his father\'s devotion for his friend George."\n\nThe people have mostly disappeared into the underground air-raid shelters. George looks at Filby\'s store, and just then an aged James Filby wearing a silvery uniform walks out on his way to the shelters. George stops to talk to him, extremely impressed by the growth of the store and the whole city. James just wants to get into the shelters as quickly as possible before the mushroom clouds appear, another phrase George doesn\'t understand. James suddenly realizes that George looks familiar, and George tells him that he talked to him in the same place, in front of the store, back in 1917 - 49 years earlier. James recognizes him as the same man but how could he possibly have not changed in such a long time? The talk is cut short when the air-raid sirens go off again, and James points to the approaching nuclear bomb and hurries off to the shelter. George lingers outside, then starts to walk back to his time machine, when the bomb goes off. George is far enough away from it not to be incinerated, but the buildings around him burst into flame and fall apart as he watches. London, built brick by brick over two thousand years, is obliterated in seconds. The explosion caused a geological disturbance, and a volcano appeared and lava flowed down the street, destroying anything in its path that had not been destroyed by the bomb. George jumped back into the time machine and escaped into the future before the lava could reach it. The lava cooled around the time machine, forming a casing of stone. George sped into the future, waiting for erosion or other natural forces to wear the rock away.\n\nThousands of years in the future, the rock eroded and George was once more out in the open, but the bleak, desolate landscape offered no hints that a city or even mankind had ever stood there. He watched trees grow. He could no longer detect changing seasons. Then he saw new buildings going up, but they appeared more primitive than the ones he had left behind. As he sped forward through the centuries, he watched a dome and a tower being built and then fall into disrepair and ruin. Curious once again, George stopped the machine on October 12, 802701. He stopped too fast, and the angular momentum from the suddenly stopped spinning disk caused the machine to spin around and fall over. Shaken but unhurt, George got out, righted it, and set out to explore.\n\nThere was a large stone building behind him, with a large metal statue on top that looks kind of like the statues on Easter Island. There are two large metal doors in the building. George knocks on them (clang!) but no one answers, and he cannot open them. George takes the glass-knobbed control handle out of the time machine, just in case, and then goes to explore the forest. The trees are laden with large, delicious-looking fruits, and he finds some more ruins, but he does not yet find any humans. After passing through the forest, he finds the dome he saw earlier. It was neglected and almost in ruins, but it was obviously still in use. It still had functioning doors, and there were tables and chairs and dinnerware inside when he entered.\n\nThere were no people, so George left the dome and went back to the forest. Continuing to walk, he at last hears voices in the distance. Finally he comes across some people, in a clearing in the forest by the river. All of them were blond-haired, dressed in plain clothes, and fairly young. They were laughing and playing, and George thinks at first that this is the future he had hoped for, where war, work, and hardship had been left behind in the past. Then he spots a woman in the river, obviously in distress. She is not able to swim through the current and seems to be in imminent danger of drowning, yet none of the other people do anything to help, just staring as the woman screams. George runs into the clearing and urges them to take action, then dives into the river and rescues the woman when they do nothing. The people just look at him.\n\nThe people get up and walk away, laughing and chattering, and they go to the dome that George left not long earlier. George follows them but lingers on the stairs. The woman he saved comes back to talk to him. She talks softly and slowly and appears to not quite be all there. She seems to think nothing of the fact that none of the other people tried to save her from drowning. She tells him her name is Weena, and her people are called "Eloi", but she is dumbfounded when he asks her to spell it. The people are illiterate. Weena encourages George to come with her into the dome, because it is getting dark.\n\nInside the dome, the people are eating the fruits laid out before them on the table. George tries to talk to some of the other Eloi people, but they are exceptionally poor conversationalists. Besides losing written language, he learns that the Eloi have no government or laws, and no one works. The food simply grows without being cultivated. The Eloi seem to have all the free time in the world, but they don\'t even study or experiment or learn anything. They have lost their human curiosity as well.\n\nGeorge asks an Eloi man if there is any way he could learn about the Eloi culture, such as from books, and the man tells him that there are indeed books. He shows George the books, which are in a dusty, long-neglected room in the back. George picks up a book which appears to be in terrible shape, and he discovered how terrible it is when he opens it to find the words faded to near-illegibility, a page crumbles to dust when he tries to turn it, and the whole book fragments to pieces in his hand. The books had been left to rot untouched for so long that he is able to put his fist through a whole shelf full of books, reducing them to powder. George now realizes how repulsive this culture is: although they had no more war and hardship, they had also lost everything that made life worthwhile over the centuries - knowledge of science, mathematics, philosophy. He returns to the dome, voices his disgust and intends to return immediately to his own time. Weena looks at him as he leaves the dome.\n\nGeorge returns to the stone building, and discovers to his horror that the time machine is gone! There are grooves in the dirt leading to the metal doors of the stone building. Apparently, someone or something dragged the machine inside. George is now trapped in the future. He picks up a rock and pounds on the doors, but they do not budge. Looking for another way in, George walks around the building and sees something moving in the bushes. It retreats when he lights a match. He sees another shape moving around, goes to check it and discovers that it is Weena! She had followed him to try to get him to come back to the dome. It was dangerous to be out at night. George asks Weena how to get inside the building behind them, and she says no one can get inside except the Morlocks. The Morlocks provide the Eloi with their food and clothing, but the Eloi must obey them. Eloi insists that they retreat to the safety of the dome, but George prefers to keep trying to get into the building, and he starts gathering wood for a fire to keep the dark at arm\'s length. She finds a wild flower, of a type unknown to George, and gives it to him.\n\nGeorge begins to talk to Eloi about when he came from. Standing in front of the building, they are in the exact same place that George\'s house used to be eight hundred thousand years earlier. While he is talking, one of the shapes George saw earlier emerges from the bushes and grabs Weena. George runs after her and beats off the attacker, but doesn\'t get a good look at it. It was a Morlock. George gets the fire going, and Weena reaches out to it curiously; she has never even seen fire before. He tells her that she seems to have a few of the traits that had been largely lost, as she tried to help him by coming out of the dome. Yet she tells him that her people have also lost the concept of past and future. George thinks that he has landed in one of Man\'s many Dark Ages and wonders if he can help lead the people out.\n\nIn the morning, George still could not open the doors to the stone building, but discoveries several artificial holes in a nearby field. He can dimly hear machines pounding on in the darkness below. Weena knows that they are another entrance to the Morlock world because some talking rings told her. George asks her to show him the rings, and she leads him back to another dusty museum area. There is a table with some rings, and George asks Weena for a demonstration. Weena spins a ring on the tabletop, which glows underneath the ring and a voice begins to speak - apparently, this is one of man\'s many later technologies that had been developed and then forgotten. The voices were old news reports. The ring spoke about the end of a 326-year war, which had ended only because so many people had been killed that there were not enough people left to fight and nothing left worth fighting with or for, resources had been depleted and pollution was rapidly killing off the survivors. George spins another ring, and this recorded voice is that of one of the last people to have a past. It described that some of the few stragglers left over from the war had gone underground to survive, and a few others had remained on the surface. George learned that those had gone underground became the Morlocks, who controlled the Eloi like cattle and took them in to an unknown fate periodically.\n\nTrailed by Weena, George returns to the field with the holes and begins to climb down a rusty ladder inside. Just then, a wailing sound begins and some rods emerge from the top of the stone building. It sounds just like the air-raid sirens during the wars. Weena appears to go into a trance and wanders off. George climbs back out of the hole to see what was going on, and sees scores of other Eloi walking like lemmings out of the dome, through the forest, towards the stone building. He can\'t get their attention, and he can\'t find Weena. Continuing through the forest, he spots her and grabs her, but she just looks blankly at him and continues walking. Closer to the building, the sounds of the siren are deafening. The metal doors to the building are wide open and the Eloi are walking through them into the building. George runs forward toward the building, but as quickly as it started, the wail of the siren ceases, the rods drop back into the building, and the metal doors close - with Weena inside and George out.\n\nThe Eloi who had not yet reached the doors suddenly came out of their trance, like they had just been woken up, and start wandering away. But none of them know what happens inside the building. They only know that it is now "all clear" - a holdover from the old days. They only know to hide underground when the sirens go off. George tries to explain to them that all the wars, sirens, all clears, and the people who had participated in them were long dead, but they don\'t seem to understand anything except that it was now all clear, and they don\'t seem the least bit perturbed that people who enter the building are never seen again. Frustrated and determined to save Weena, George returns to the field with the holes and climbs down. The Eloi on the surface look down at him.\n\nUnderground, George can hear the machinery, and finds some wood and tinder to make a torch, but doesn\'t light it yet. He explores the underground chambers and sees some of the machines. Some figures move around in the background - Morlocks - watching him, and he is aware that something is there but doesn\'t see them yet. Wandering into the next room, George sees human skeletons, and miscellaneous human bones sitting in bowls and on plates. It\'s a dining room, and he now sees that the Morlocks have turned cannibal and the Eloi who enter the building became dinner.\n\nGeorge returns to the main underground room and explores a little more, then he sees a Morlock clearly for the first time -- they are short, squat beings with glowing eyes, drooping faces, long white hair and bluish-gray skin. It is driving the complacent Eloi with a whip in their walk to the slaughter. George spots Weena in line, and grabs her and removes her from the line and tries to wake her from her trance. A male Eloi wakes up and follows. George\'s cover has been blown and a Morlock attacks him from behind with the whip, and he drops his stick. George is able to wrest the whip from the Morlock\'s grasp and begins attacking it. Several more Morlocks joins the fray, and George must retreat.\n\nRemembering their fear of fire, George lights a match, and the Morlocks retreat, but the match goes out soon and they can advance again. One of the Morlocks tackles him while he is fumbling with the matches. He is able to escape and go over to where the stick landed. He tries to light it, but he\'s running out of matches. Weena runs over to him and gives him a piece of cloth torn from her dress to burn. George puts it on the end of the stick and lights it. While George keeps the Morlocks at bay with the torch, the Eloi start moving towards the stairs, but then he drops the torch and he is reduced to fighting with his fists. The Morlocks are not very effective in the melee, but there are a lot of them. Weena tries to grab the torch, but she is once again grabbed by a Morlock. George saves her once again, punching the Morlock repeatedly. Another Morlock charges him and this time seems to get the upper hand. One of the male Eloi, having just seen the fight, makes a fist for the first time in his life and imitates George, attacking the Morlock and knocking it out.\n\nGeorge sees the torch guttering and there are more Morlocks still. He grabs it and sends the remaining Eloi up the stairs and follows them, protecting their rear from being followed. The Morlocks try to follow but they must keep a respectful distance from the fire. On his way up the stairs, George passes some flammable liquid and lights it with the torch. The Eloi find more Morlocks blocking their path going up the stairs, but they are able to knock them off the stairs into the fire. Soon the fire spreads to the machines on the floor. The Eloi reach the bottom of the ladders and begin to climb out of the holes, which are already belching smoke. Urged by George, they gather up more dead branches and drop them down into the holes to add fuel to the fire. There is a secondary explosion and one of the walls around the holes falls in. George and the Eloi run to the river, and then there are more explosions underground and the entire chamber and the ground on top collapses into the hole.\n\nThe Morlock underworld and the danger it presented had been destroyed, but so too was the shiftless lifestyle of the Eloi as livestock. Yet George was still trapped. He talks to Weena again, and she asks him if he is unhappy that he has to stay where he is. He still wants to return home and tell his own people what he learned. He realizes he doesn\'t fit in in the future. Weena is interested in seeing George\'s time and wonders if he has any girl-friends there. He doesn\'t, but he has his male friends, and his 62-year-old maid. Weena obviously likes him. Their chat is interrupted by the other Eloi, who race into the clearing to draw their attention to the stone building. It too is in flames, and the doors are wide open. The time machine is just inside. George is overcome with joy and pulls the glass-handled control stick out of his pocket. He runs forward to the machine and calls for Weena to join him, intending to take her home with him. But once he is inside, the doors close again with a metallic "bong!" and he can\'t open them from the inside, either. Worse, a few surviving Morlocks are coming up the stairs out of the conflagration below. George climbs into the machine but still has to beat off the remaining Morlocks as he gets the machine started. He continues forward, into the future, and watches the dead Morlock on the floor rot to a skeleton and then to dust. Realizing that he\'s been about as far into the future as he cares to see, he reverses the direction of the control stick, sending the time machine hurtling back into the past. Exhausted, he leans back in the machine as the time passes in reverse rapidly backwards. He slows the machine as it finally reaches the early twentieth century, finally bringing it to a stop on January 5, 1900, the night he\'d invited his friends over to dinner. He\'s back when he started - the only difference is he and his machine are outside in the garden now, instead of in the laboratory where he left. He has to break into his own house just as a distant clock tower chimes 8 p.m. Battered from his fights with the Morlocks, he stumbles into his house to greet his guests.\n\nAfter he has finished telling them his story, it\'s after 9 p.m., and his friends still don\'t believe him. They think he\'s a great storyteller, though. George doesn\'t know how to make them understand, but he reaches into his pocket and finds the flower that Weena gave him. Handing it to David Filby, he challenges him to match it to any species known in the present day and tell him how he obtained it in such condition in the middle of winter. He is stumped.\n\nHis friends get ready to leave, telling George he appears exhausted, as he no doubt is. As before, Filby lingers to talk to him. George makes his goodbyes to him, and they sound final, as if he suspects he might not see him again. Filby talks to the other men in the carriage, and he sounds like he almost believes the story himself. Then as the carriage drives off, Filby returns to the house to check on George. George is dragging the time machine through the falling snow back into the laboratory. While Filby is looking for George, he hears the time machine being revved up. He reaches the laboratory with Mrs. Watchett but not in time to see George disappear bound for the future once more. However, he does see the open doors and the tracks made by the time machine\'s brass runners.\n\nSuddenly, Filby realizes that it\'s true as the pieces of the puzzle fall into place. George had built his time machine in the laboratory, and it traveled through time but not through space. When he had returned home, it appeared in the garden, but this was only because the Morlocks had moved it a few dozen yards into their building in the far future. The patch of ground occupied by the laboratory would eventually be just outside the stone building, and the place where the garden was would be just inside it eight hundred thousand years in the future. George had dragged the machine back to its original location so that when he returned to the future, he would be outside the building and those impenetrable doors, outside, in the last place he had seen Weena.\n\nReturning to the parlor, Filby realizes that George would probably have taken something with him if he intended to help the Eloi rebuild their culture, and sure enough, three books are missing from the shelves. They don\'t know which books. Filby and Mrs. Watchett wonder if George will ever return, and if so, when, but Filby realizes that George has, quite literally, all the time in the world. He leaves, and Mrs. Watchett turns out the lights.']
['The film opens with Charlie Fox (River Phoenix) explaining that his father, Allie Fox (Harrison Ford), is a brilliant inventor with "nine patents, six pending." Allie has grown fed up with the American Dream and American consumerism, believing that Americans "buy junk, sell junk and eat junk," and that there is an impending nuclear war on the horizon as a result of American greed and crime.\n\nAllie and Charlie go to a hardware store to buy components for a new invention, an ice machine known as Fat Boy. Upon seeing that the product was made in Japan, Allie refuses to purchase it. After Allie and Charlie acquire the components at a local dump, he finishes assembling his creation. Allie\'s boss and asparagus farm owner, Mr. Polski (Dick O\'Neill) complains that Allie is not tending to the asparagus, which is rotting. Allie, Charlie, and Allie\'s youngest son, Jerry (Jadrien Steele), meet Mr. Polski, and Allie shows him "Fat Boy." The machine leaves Polski unimpressed. As he drives past the fields, a dejected Allie comments on immigrants picking asparagus, and says that where they come from, they might think of ice as a luxury. The home of the migrant workers is in a state of disarray, exemplifying their poverty.\n\nThat night, Jerry tells "Mother" (Helen Mirren), that he believes something terrible is about to happen. Mother rebuffs her son, explaining that she believes something good will happen. The next morning, Allie throws a party for the immigrant workers before telling his family that they\'re leaving the United States. After they board a Panamanian barge, the family meets Reverend Spellgood (Andre Gregory), a Christian missionary, his wife (Melanie Boland), and their daughter, Emily (Martha Plimpton). Emily flirts with Charlie. Allie and the Reverend begrudgingly try to get along, despite having entirely different religious views. When the barge docks in Belize City, the families disembark and go their separate ways. Allie, with the consent of the Belize government, purchases a small village called Jeronimo in the rainforest along the river.\n\nMr. Haddy (Conrad Roberts) takes Allie and his family upriver to Jeronimo. Allie meets the inhabitants and proceeds to start building a new, \'advanced\' civilization, in the process inventing many new things. The locals take kindly to Allie and his family, but Allie\'s will to build a utopic civilization keeps them working to their limits. One day, Reverend Spellgood arrives to convert Jeronimo\'s citizens. In the process, Allie and Spellgood angrily denounce each other, leading to a permanent schism: Allie believes Spellgood to be a religious zealot; Spellgood believes Allie to be a communist. Allie sets to constructing a huge version of "Fat Boy" that can supply Jeronimo with ice. Upon completing the machine, Allie hears rumors of a native tribe in the mountains that have never seen ice. Allie recruits his two sons to carry a load of ice into the jungle to supply the tribe. Upon arriving, Allie finds that the load has melted, and that the tribe has already been visited by missionaries.\n\nWhen Allie returns to Jeronimo, he learns that Spellgood has left with much of the populace, scaring them with stories of God\'s biblical destruction. The near-empty town is visited by rebels, who demand to use Jeronimo as a guerrilla base. Allie and his family accept to accommodate them while Allie constructs a plan to be rid of them. Set on freezing them to death, Allie bunks the rebels up in the giant ice machine, tells Charlie to lock its only other exit, and activates it. The rebels, waking in panic, try to shoot their way through. To Allie\'s horror, the rebels\' gunfire sets off an explosion within the machine. By the next morning, both the machine and the family\'s home is in ruins. Worse, the chemicals from the destroyed machine have severely polluted the river.\n\nForced downstream, Allie and his family arrive at the coast. Mother and the children rejoice, believing they can return to the United States. Allie, refusing to believe his dream has been shattered, announces that they have all they need on the beach and, lying, tells the family that America has been destroyed in a nuclear war. Settling on the beach in a houseboat he has built, and refusing assistance from Mr. Haddy, a paranoid Allie believes that the family has accomplished building a utopia. One night, the storm surge from a tropical cyclone nearly forces the family out to sea until Charlie reveals that he has been hiding motor components given to him by Mr. Haddy, allowing them to start the motor on the boat. The family becomes physically and emotionally weaker for lack of food, shelter, and other human companionship.\n\nTraveling upstream once again, the family stumbles across Spellgood\'s compound. Coming ashore, Allie sees barbed wire, and mutters that the settlement is a Christian concentration camp. While the rest of the family sleeps, Charlie and Jerry sneak over to the Spellgood home. After finding out that the United States was not destroyed and that Emily will assist them in escaping from Allie, Charlie obtains the keys to a jeep. Before Charlie can convince Mother and his sisters to leave, Allie sets Spellgood\'s church on fire. Spellgood shoots Allie, paralyzing him from the neck down. The family escapes aboard the boat.\n\nThe film concludes with the group traveling downriver again, where Allie drifts in and out of consciousness. Allie asks his wife if they are going upstream. She lies to himgoing against the wishes of her husband for the first time. Charlie\'s final narration reports the death of Allie, but gives hope that the rest of the family can live their lives freely from now on.']

['In the future, the Metropolis of Metro City is suspended above the Earth using advanced technology. Situated through the city are numerous robots who do many of the chores and tasks for the human occupants. When a robot fails to have a use any longer, it is pitched over the side onto the cluttered landscape far below.\n\nOne day, after acing another quiz, Toby Tenma is being driven home by his family\'s robot butler, Orrin. However, Orrin explains that Toby\'s father, Dr Tenma, has a meeting at the Ministry of Science. Wanting to see his Dad in action, Toby temporarily reprograms Orrin to take him there.\n\nToby manages to sneak in, and comes across his Dad talking to President Stone, who has been working with Dr Tenma and Dr Elefun to create a Peacekeeping robot, the likes of which he hopes will help him be re-elected.\n\nDr Elefun explains that using a fallen star, he was able to synthesize both a positive and negative energy effect from this star. Stone is more intent on the use of the red core, and places this in the Peacekeeping robot, which soon turns it into a negative force, that begins to absorb other items to grow larger and increase it\'s weaponry.\n\nThe group manages to get behind a shield to stop the robot from destroying them, but Toby does not make it in time, and is vaporized by the robot, before Dr Elefun can shut it down.\n\nHeartbroken over the loss of his son, Dr Tenma works in secret with Dr Elefun to create a robotic duplicate of Toby, using a strand of his son\'s hair and memories that have been stored away. Dr Elefun provides Tenma with the blue energy core to power the new Toby, who comes to life as if nothing had ever happened to him.\n\nTenma attempts to have Toby reclaim his original genius-level thinking, but Toby\'s mental power is more focused on some more fun things than actual study. When Toby retreats to his room, he sees some cleaner bots outside, and is surprised that he can understand them! Toby tries to take a closer look, but ends up falling out of his window. On the way down, he unknowingly activates rocket boots, and soon, joyously takes off in flight.\n\nReturning home, Toby is dismayed when he finds Dr Elefun there, on orders from Dr Tenma to help him shut down Toby. Tenma has found it almost impossible to see the new Toby as his son, and thinks of him more as a machine than anything. Dr Elefun cannot bring himself to shut down Toby, and explains to the robot-boy that he probably has a destiny far outside of the world he has known. Toby then leaves, and flies off over Metro City.\n\nMeanwhile, President Stone, still smarting over the fiasco with the Peacekeeping robot, is growing more and more disturbed that his eventual re-election seems unlikely. When his troops find Toby flying through the air, Stone is shocked, and assumes that the blue energy core that Elefun synthesized must be powering the boy. Stone orders his men to capture Toby, but they are outdone at every turn. Finally, Stone attempts to destroy Toby to get the blue core, but ends up blowing Toby off Metro City to the ground below. Stone then orders his men to scan the world below to find Toby.\n\nToby wakes up on a scrap pile of old robots, but soon is found by a group of kids, scavenging for old parts. Toby\'s introduction does not last long, when he is whisked away by three robots, claiming to be part of a group called the "Robot Revolutionary Front." The three members claim they have liberated Toby, and give him the nickname of "Astro." Toby eventually finds his way out of their grasp, but the RRF warns Toby to beware of a man named Hamegg, who they claim destroys robots.\n\nAstro rejoin the group of kids, led by a girl named Cora. He finds their home where a number of wayward kids live, and are supervised by Hamegg himself. However, Astro is relieved when Hamegg explains to him that he loves robots, and works to fix them up.\n\nThe next day, the kids along with Astro go looking for spare parts. They come across a giant robot that has been non-functioning for some time. Unseen by the kids, Astro uses the power of his blue core to revive the giant robot, known as Zog.\n\nThe kids greatly impress Hamegg when they return with the enormous robot. They then proceed to clean him up and paint him up.\n\nLater that evening, Astro finds Cora attempting to call her parents in Metro City, but she claim she can\'t get through, and wonders if they have forgotten her.\n\nThe next day, the group along with Hamegg, take Zog to the Robot Wars. Astro is further shocked to find that Hamegg rebuilds robots as fodder to fight in the wars. Hamegg claims that since robots have no emotions or feelings, it shouldn\'t matter...right before he zaps Astro, rendering him unconscious. This move shocks Cora and the others, until Hamegg explains that he knows that Astro is really a human-looking robot.\n\nHamegg then pits Astro against other robots in the Robot Wars arena. Astro tries not to fight, but soon finds himself being forced to do so against the other combatants. Hamegg then sends Zog to fight Astro, but the giant robot refuses, due to being helped/powered up by Astro. When Hamegg zaps Astro trying to force him to fight, Zog attempts to break the first rule of robotics and destroy him, until Astro intervenes.']

['The film opens with a lady writing a letter to who seems to be a future daughter.The scene cuts to two brothers, Karl and David Scott along with their father boarding a plane, albeit to David\'s reluctance to go. Karl eventually takes over the controls as his father falls asleep. They encounter a severe thunderstorm; the father wakes back up and manages to take control of the plane, but to no avail as it crashes into the ocean. Karl and David both manage to get free and swim out of the sinking plane. When Karl goes back to rescue his father, he gets pushed away by the latter. Conceding the loss, he surfaces with David in the turbulent waters. They soon discover that they are on the shore of a large uncharted island.\n\nAs they examine what appears to be an ancient fossil structure, a sudden explosion occurs and destroys it. Emerging from the smoke, is a man named Cyrus Crabb who leads the duo to a nearby village. All of a sudden, a commotion occurs; a rampaging Ankylosaurus is on the loose. The disturbance is soon quelled by a girl, who turns out to be Marion Waldo, revealing the source of the trouble to be a toothache. The brothers then join Marion and they travel with a convoy on a Brachiosaurus to leave the village.\n\nLater on in the evening the dinos inexplicably stop in the middle of the woods as apparently something has frightened them. As the group travels along a nearby trail, they happen upon giant footprints, indicating that they\'re clearly not alone. They find what looks to be have been an abandoned village; since a storm is presently brewing nearby, Marion recommends that the group find shelter for the night. During the night, David has trouble falling asleep as he believes he hears noises from outside. He wakes up Karl to alert him, and when he does, the noises seemingly vanish. All of a sudden, a giant dinosaur foot comes crashing thru the roof of the room. Realizing that a herd of Tyrannosaurus Rex has descended upon the settlement, the group flees posthaste. The monsters are soon driven off by a squadron of SkyBax, led by Captain Oonu.\n\nThe group resumes their journey and soon arrive at Waterfall City, the capital of Dinotopia, a hidden civilization where humans and dinosaurs peacefully coexist. They soon meet Marion\'s father, Mayor Waldo Seville of Dinotopia. After signing their names onto the scroll, they then make their way to the Library where the group meet the librarian, a talking Troodon named Zippo Stenosaurus. Since the brothers are nomads, Zippo offers his place as temporary lodging. Being Dinotopian citizens, Karl and David enroll soon in Dinotopian class, with David quickly surging ahead as far as the learning curve goes. Zippo picks up on a few things such as ping-pong, thanks to Karl. The homesickness continues to grate on Karl, until finally he goes to Cyrus Crabb in order to find out how to get off Dinotopia. Cyrus agrees to help him -- on the condition that Karl steal a book from the library that contains the routes of the surrounding area. Initially Karl refuses, but then Cyrus counters by mentioning how the "Scalies" (a derogatory term used by Cyrus to refer to species of Troodon\'s race) bit off one of his legs in the past due to a disagreement he had with one of them. Karl finally relents and ends up stealing the book whilst Zippo and the others are attending a ceremony.\n\nMarion tries to encourage Karl to resume his studies to which he reluctantly agrees. He arrives late for an exam and scrambles to complete the test. Cryus examines the contents of the book Karl took. When Cyrus mentions that he also needs something additional which wasn\'t part of the original deal between the two, Karl quickly objects. Cyrus then takes Karl outside and shows him how David has become more assimilated in the Dinotopian culture. When the test results are announced, Karl is credited with having the superior score, much to the chagrin of David. Jealous, he confronts Karl knowing that the only way he could have gotten such a high score was due to cheating. The argument then escalates and results in the two getting in a brief scuffle, which takes them over the edge of a balcony and plunging into the depths of the waterfall below. Marion begs her father to let her go after the two but is denied.\n\nUndeterred, she embarks on the search accompanied by Zippo. She then begins by kidnapping one of the Messenger Birds with a basket and then instructing it to fly high and low to locate Karl and David. Eventually, Karl surfaces, holding an unconscious David in the river that the waterfall descends into. After setting down David to rest, Karl then sees what looks to be a pathway over the river to an ancient temple. Curious, he begins his trek across the plank. David eventually regains some consciousness again later that night as he and Karl have a discussion across the fire, only for David to descend back under again. Desperate to quench his thirst, Karl returns to the pathway and kneels down on the edge and drinks some of the water, unaware that the river is infested with a species of underwater canivores known as Mosasaurus. The Messenger Bird finally finds Karl and lands on a nearby rock to relay the message from Marion. After Karl confirms that he is the intended recepeient, the bird flies away.\n\nKarl returns and is restocking the fire with several branches of wood when he hears the voice of Marion calling them both. She eventually rescusistates David by putting her hand on him. Zippo orders the Messenger Bird to fly back to the mainland and request a rescue team. Later on Karl and Zippo investigate the walls of the temple and find carvings..Karl then sees the tail of one of the creatures above the water and realizes that they\'ve committed a serious violation by way of trespassing into their domain of the temple. Karl breaks camp and takes David to make his way back while Marion runs to the temple and shouts at Zippo to leave immediately. Meanwhile the river has now come alive as the agitated Mosasauraus are out in full force. Knowing that the pathway is the only hope of ever making it back to the mainland, Karl races back across with David on his shoulders, despite the repeated attempts by the creatures to ram the bridge in order for them to fall into the water. Marion and Zippo next cross the bridge but are confronted by one. While the creature is distracted with a scuffle with one of its own, Marion races by and leaps to the other side. Zippo is about to go next when one of the Mosasaurs rams the section that he\'s standing on and sends him into the river. It bits onto the tail and attempts to keep him submerged. A courageous Karl goes to the riverbank and manages to fish Zippo out with his bare hands to safety.\n\nMarion climbs up a tree and scours the horizon..she soon locates the rescue party as they also locate her. They\'re escorted into the town where they meet Rosemary Waldo, Marion\'s mother. Karl goes off to care for David, while Marion and her mother do some catching up. A change of locale doesn\'t phase Zippo and Karl\'s love of ping-pong. After Karl is redirected to focus on actually helping out in the new setting, he eventually takes Marion out for a swim. The two are confronted by Rosemary about this.\n\nDuring a hearing, Zippo requests an expedition to The World Beneath, to extract sunstones from the area in order to replace the currently failing ones now on the surface of Dinotopia, but he\'s promptly turned down by the Mayor. Cyrus is watching and taking note. At a session, Karl attempts to exit but due to the consistent pouding of the ground by the dinosaurs, he succumbs and falls to the earth.\nAfter graduation, David is assigned to train in the SkyBax Corps, while Karl is assigned to the Hatchery. David and Marion leave and go to a hilly section of the city where David is to train. He meets another cadet. Karl arrives at the hatchery and is given an egg with the number "26" on it, much to Karl\'s chagrin.\n\nDavid\'s training begins by his instructor, Captain Oonu who shows them how to call a SkyBax. Karl goes to Rosemary to tell her that he didn\'t sign up to take care of an infant Chasmosarus. She responds by telling him to care for any responsiblity properly. David expresses apprehension to OOnu, who just looks at him and keeps walking.\n\nMarion goes to a ledge to paint when she sees an albino Skybax being harassed by a few Pternadon. The Sunstones are failing and nearly cause Pternadon to fly upwards from their domain. At the hearing, Cyrus this time speaks out and dumps a bag with defunct stones onto the floor for all to see. The mayor, knowing what was said to be true, has guards arrive to escort Cyrus away. Frustrated, he flings the empty bag on the floor and storms out. He then approaches Zippo about the situation; Zippo follows him to his shop. While there, he finds items that were stolen some time ago and when he goes to report it, Cyrus knocks him out, stuffs him in a bag and leaves him in a boat in the river.\n\nThe egg hatches and Karl gives the infant the name "26". Zippo is discovered and pulled up by the authorities. David now has to jump over the ledge to get to the next phase of training. Marion attempts to calm the Skybax, but eventually she gets attacked by the Pternadon. She manages to pull away by showing her Sunstone to them as David takes her. She\'s banned from returning.\n\nKarl finds a boat in broken condition but gathers materials and patches it back up, as he still has a desire to leave the island. David continues to work at honing his skills on the flying mechanism. However, this does not affect the outcome that later comes when Oonu doesn\'t award him. David and Marion scale the mountain and spend the night in a nest. As Karl wakes up, he finds the Chasmasaurus playing around with the toys on the floor. He puts up back in its crib, to which it eventually falls asleep.\n\nHe soon does the unthinkable: removing the sunstone from above the Hatchery. David encounters the Skybax and names him Freefall. Cyrus then gives Karl a map to help him navigate in exchange for the recently stolen sunstone, though Karl is unaware that Cyrus had cut a hole in the boat to help sabotage him. Cyrus finds its a dead stone realizing he was crossed.\n\nKarl throws back the actual sunstone back far enough so that it lands on the roof. The Chasmosarus wakes up and instinctively goes to the shoreline where Karl had departed from. Water has start to come into the boat and Karl tries to dish it out. The infant dinosaur runs to the ledge and calls. Karl realizes that 26 was following him and tells it to leave. The dinosaur jumps into the water; Karl, knowing it hasn\'t learned to swim, abandones the sinking boat and rescues it. He surfaces and glances back just to see the boat finally go under.\n\nDavid attempts to call a Skybax but none come. Oonu dismisses him from the Corps. Determined to try again, he goes again and this time the Skybax whom he named Freefall heeds his call and with that David gets on and they fly into the distance.\n\nCaptain Oonu and his SkyBax squadron enter the court hall to request Mayor Waldo\'s audience and informs him that Waterfall City is threatened with an imminent Pternadon incursion thanks to the failure of the sunstones. The mayor responds that they don\'t have the needed resources and that all need to be prepared to potentially face death. As the mayor makes his way out, he is greeted by a massive influx of refugees from a nearby city of Dinotopia. \n\nDavid, Karl and Marion decide to return back to the temple that contains the gateway to the world Beneath. After leaving 26 in the care of Zippo, they begin their departure when inadvertently stopped by Cyrus Crabb, who advises them to turn back now while they still can to which the group refuses. Karl mentions that he knows Cyrus sabotaged his boat and Cyrus retorts that he was given a faulty sunstone so he now considers this tit-fot-tat to be even. He then gives Karl a flare gun and tells him there are much more than Mosasaurs to be concerned about.\n\nAs they travel through the forest, Marion asks Karl about the theft of the Hatchery sunstone to which he agrees that he did. Karl asks about her and David and she says that they were close. The group arrive at the entrance and proceed to a fountain. Karl looks thru his bag when a stone falls into the fountain by accident. He then takes out the flare gun and shoots it upwards to illuminate the area above them. The flare also causes the Pternadons nestled there to stir. Realizing this the group feels back from the temple to outside to behold a huge swarm of Pternadon rising in a swirl from the temple. They encounter Oonu, who places them under arrest. \n\nAt the hearing, Mayor brings twenty one violations of the laws, just as Zippo rushes in and speaks in their defense and presents his tail as evidence. Oonu and Rosemay testify in favor of Karl and David. Marion tries to get the father to free them but he insists its for the greater good. During the conversation, the lights go out as the sunstones are failing. At the next session yet again, the mayor gives the defendants to say some final thoughts to which Karl volunteers and candidly speaks about how no one is truly listened to in Dinotopia and tells him to listen now. He could care less about the rules and says that his brother not be punished.\nHe concludes his speech by saying the city is going under and something needs to be done. Cyrus notices something while going over the writings.\n\nThe judgement is rendered: Karl and David are allowed to remain in Waterfall City to complete their studies. Karl is deemed unfit to care for an infant and it will be donated to the orphange. Cyrus pays a visit to Zippo\'s home to make the group an offer: to accompany him on the journey to the World Beneath. In order for them to get the last book by Arthur Dennison, Cyrus mixes a rare plant substance and tells Marion to give it to the guards which puts them out giving them time to leave and go to the library. Cyrus uses this as another setup. David discovers the book the next morning, as the city guards led by Mayor Waldo go to apprehend them once and for all. They burst in and the four flee out the back door of the library. \n\nThey manage to escape capture as they find the boat that Cyrus left for them and head into a roller-coaster like ride underneath the tunnels of the city. The group locates a ship where Cyrus is waiting. He then takes them to where their means of transport- a submersible piloted by Cyrus\'s father when he took the journey to the World Beneath. After getting it working in short order, Cyrus asks Marion if they can use her sunstone from the necklace to help power the sub to which she agrees. Karl installs it in the sub and it powers up the machine. \n\nOnly David and Karl go as the sub can hold just three. Meanwhile, Romana flies and tells the mayor that 100,000 Pternadon are on their way towards the city and that she must warn the other cities. They find the wreckage of the plane that had crashed and search for any sign of their father. The sub emerges at the entrance to the World Beneath, which happens to be guarded by a giant prehistorice eel by the name Dunkleosteus.\n\nThey discover carvings which depict the history of the dinosaurs and how Dinotopia came to be. A vigil is held in Waterfall City; the groups starts seeing sunstones on the ground. Cyrus eventually finds the opening and everyone craws through it and finds it leads to a vast Sunstone cave. David surmises that the meteor that crashed into the earth was the sunstone cave that they\'re in. They then begin collecting stones.\n\nAfter they finish loading the stones into the submersible, Karl and David tell Cyrus that they\'ve carried a heavy load and that they will need to make a second trip. Cyrus responds by saying that he doesn\'t think the aging sub doesn\'t has the means to make a second trip and that means that something or someone will have to be left behind. David realizes that he\'s referring to Karl and him. Cyrus goes to leave and David attempts to stop him but Cyrus hits him in the stomach and throws him to the ground. Karl lunges at Cyrus but is held up by his cane. Karl says that he knew that Cyrus couldn\'t be trusted from the beginning and forcefully pushes the cane away from him and back at Cyrus and bars his fists. Cyrus sees this as a invitation to fight and after a brief standoff he hits Karl in the stomach with the cane and prepares to knock him down when a hand grabs his arm. Karl sees that this is his Dad and that he has survived. \n\nCyrus points a gun at them and Karl tells him he\'s not going anywhere to which Cyrus responds by shooting him in the knee. David approaches and Cyrus pulls out another gun, but is stopped as Karl tells him to let Cyrus go. The father quickly wraps a bandage around the wound and then expresses his amazement that his sons are still alive and well. He reveals that he survived by swimming out of the plane and heading for what he thought was the surface but what ended up being the surface of the World Beneath. \n\nThey know they need to find a way out but David says that there\'s none as Cyrus has left. Karl ssays that he won\'t get very far without the sunstone from Marion. The sub\'s engine sputters and Cyrus realizes that once again, Karl has crossed him once more. He frantically dumps out a bag of sunstones and tries fitting in various ones into the slot but none fit. He knocks over his pistol which hits the floor and fires a bullet which ricochets around the inside and then cracks the front glass causing sea water to seep in. The sea monster now heads in the direction of the sub. Cyrus looks back in horror as he sees the massive head of the eel cross the bow of his sub. Cyrus realizes that his fate is now sealed saying, "No, no..not like this."\nThe eel turns away for a moment as Cyrus tries one last time with the controls to move the sub, but without the sunstone to power it, is dead in the water. Water now pours in and the inside is now rapidly filling with water as Cyrus strains to see what is the opening maw of the Dunkleosteus coming straight for him. The creature swallows the submersible whole.\n\nThe boys and father look and see remants of the sub float to the surface along with Cyrus\'s wooden leg. Cyrus is no more. \n\nMeanwhile, the swarm of Pternadon finally arrive and begin their attack on Waterfall City, swooping and picking at random citizens. The three now search for a way out and come to a entry point that the duo deduce should lead back to the temple gateway. The father is hesitant to go back in the water having already been through a traumatic experience with the plane crash earlier but thanks to convincing on the part of David he goes along. On the count of three they all jump in and begin swimming upward, with David using the sunstone he carried from the cave to light the way. They finally reach the surface and make their way out the temple. David gets on Freefall and flies towards Waterfall City. Once they reach there, a group of Pterandons chase after them. Freefall performs a sharp turn which causes the Pternadon to fly into each other. A few more chase David into the sky and as he pulls out the stone, the Pternadon knocks it out off his hands and falls onto the gorund. Marion picks it up and runs to put it in place with Zippo following. \n\nAs she prepares to put it in, a Pternadon crashes its head through the windows and knocks her to the ground. Zippo tries to wake her but to no avail. He then takes the sunstone and puts it in the temple center stand. It illuminates the city once again and sends the Pternadon swarm fleeing in all directions. \n\nAt a ceremony, David is awarded a medal for his valor and courage in the attack. He inquires as to the whereabouts of his brother and father to which Waldo says that they haven\'t been located yet. The gathering is interrupted as everyone goes outside to see that Karl and his father have returned. Karl is reunited with 26 and introduces Marion to his father, who himself is still overwhelmed by his new surroundings. Zippo also introduces himself. \n\nMayor Waldo Seville, now with Rosemary, greets the father with glowing approval of Karl and David. The mayor proudly drops the charges against them and reinstates David back into the SkyBax Corps, while Karl is reappointed as the guardian of the infant Chasmosaurus. He then gives an impromptu speech to the citizens of how progress must never be sacrificed for the sake of tradition. But Karl has one more surprise up his sleeve: he hands the infant to his father and gets up on the wagon to unveil a motherload of sunstones to the amazement of all in attendace as he announces to all that the gateway to the World Beneath is now open again. This draws tremendous applause from everyone. The brothers embrace one another and are commended by the Waldo family. The film ends with the celebration of all in Waterfall City, Dinotopia.']

['Based upon the controversial 1957 novel by Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged follows the struggles of Dagny Taggart, a railroad heiress trying to maintain her integrity, and keep her family\'s railroad alive in the midst of a rapidly decaying world. She faces increasingly corrupt government agencies, the cowardly incompetence of her own brother, and the systematic loss of her best and most competent workers. As she works to overcome each obstacle, she begins to detect a pattern, and suspect a sinister force working against her. All across the country, there is a growing sense of helplessness, often summed up in a phrase that everyone seems to know, but no one knows the origin of - Who is John Galt?.\n\nOne by one, the best and brightest industrialists in the country have been disappearing overnight without a trace, and abandoning their businesses to be cannibalized by corrupt political interests. But many are disappearing just as she needs them most, leading her to realize that someone, some destroyer, is keeping just ahead of her, and is working against her. As she wonders what he could be telling these men - to get them to give up everything and disappear - she knows she must somehow beat him if she wants Taggart Transcontinental to survive.\n\nShe pursues the mystery cross country looking for clues to the destroyer, and also to find the inventor of a revolutionary motor she found in a trash pile of an abandoned industrial lab. As the world sinks further into decay, she knows her time for saving her railroad, and maybe staving off the collapse of the world around her, is growing short. However, the revelations she seeks will ultimately challenge her views, and force her to decide between fighting in her world, or leaving everything she\'s valued behind.\n_____\n\nKrystelClaire\'s synopsis:\n\n2nd September 2016: The Middle East crisis and a huge oil spil has provoked a shortage of oil all over the world. Back in the USA, it\'s become legal for profitable companies to fire as many employees as they want, and prices and salaries have become fixed by law. In this situation, strikes, turmoils and rebellions start soon. One of the consequences of all this is that the train system has become the only affordable transportation means. However, we can see the railroad\'s main problem: derailments have stopped being scarce.\n\nOn TV, there is a politicial debate over the situation. Ellis Wyatt, a Colorado oil enterpreneur (Graham Beckel) and James "Jim" Taggart (Matthew Marsden), the young president of the Taggart Transcontinental, dismisses the derailments in his company, saying that people is more worried about speed. The representative of the government does not seem able to bring out any suggestions. James is accused of being incompetent and not being able to fill the shoes of his late father by Wyatt. Wesley Mouch (Michael Lerner), a Washington lobbyist, is also present.\n\nIn a diner, a waitress (Olivia Presely) cares about a bump (Frank Cassavetes) who enters to protect himself about the heavy rain and cold outside, and who has no money to pay for his food. She also gives his takeaway order to a wealthy-looking man (Geoff Pierson) who leaves. There is another man who looks mysterious, in a hat and a long coat, who leaves right after the rich man. The mysterious man goes after the wealthy man, saying to him that he is used to work for himself, not letting a company take away the profits he has created; the wealthy man agrees with him, seeing himself in that definition, and then asks the poor man about his name. The images freeze and the audience can read a caption: MISSING: MICHAEL "MIDAS" MULLIGAN - BANKING CEO - VANISHED: SEPTEMBER 2, 2016.\n\nTitle credits  Atlas Shrugged \n\nIn her luxurious apartment, Dagny Taggart (Taylor Schilling) is phoned and told to watch a certain TV programme. She listens to reporter Denise Greco (Jan Morris) reports another train wreckage in Granby, Colorado. Dagny walks to the underground. Meanwhile, James is said that people are cancelling tickets like crazy, because the machines of the company are really old. His assistant, Eddie Willers (Edi Gathegi) is the messanger of bad news, but James accuses him of just wanting to take on his job. Dagny has to step in. The Taggart Transcontinental with new materials and new engineering methods; for example, she does with Jimmy\'s idea of buying all the steel to Orren, in spite of the problems that company is causing to them. There is a lot at stake in Colorado: the company really needs things to work out there.\n\nTrain station in Philadelphia. Dagny reads about continuing oil catastrophes in the world. Henry "Hank" Rearden (Grant Bowler) is working on a new engine for the trains. He rejects meeting many people, including the guilds; Dagny calls on him. They both admit that they need each other, in the sense that both their businesses may lose it all if the deal does not end well. She offers him 20,000 dollars per town is he is able to make the motors work in nine months. As the CEO of Rearden Steel, he understands the kind of pressures she has to deal with: an incompetent brother and corrupt politicians. He thinks that Rearden Metal will do the job very well - a new alloy twice as strong with half the weight. Dagny leaves in her car driven by a chauffer. Henry walks home. At home, his wife Lillian Rearden (Rebecca Wisocky) is having a small gathering of friends and relatives. As a birthday present, Lillian is given a beautifully crafted bracelet made of steel, which she snobbily sneers at, even after having pressed him on compromising him on his attendance to their tenth anniversary celebration in three months\' time. His mother (Christina Pickles) says that only a diamond bracelet could do. Phillip Rearden, his brother (Neill Barry) asks him for some money, but his charity group, which cares for the unpriviledted, doesn\'t want to know that the money comes from him. Henry has got a reputation for caring only about money, which he admits. His best friend Paul Larkin (atrick Fischler) loved the bracelet as it is, and he advises Henry to mind public opinion. The press is also against him. This is also the first time that John Galt\'s name is mentioned. Paul wonders who he is.\n\nAt a high end restaurant, Wesley, James, Paul and politician Orren Boyle (Jon Polito) meet. Paul doesn\'t want Henry to be hurt, but Orren and Wesley betray Henry without looking back. Boyle wants to pass a law limiting the number of business that a single person may have, but to make sure that the law gets approved, he asks James for money; in exchange, the investigation about the Granby accident will be scrapped. At that moment, Francisco D\'Anconia (Jsu Garcia) enters, with a girl on each arm. Everybody looks at him and whispers his name. He is a rich heir turned bon-vivant playboy. Paul leaves the meeting. James looks at Francisco, surrouned by beautiful girls who want to have their photographs taken with him.\n\nDagny looks for a contractor to rebuild the Colorado line. James is furious when he learns that Dagny has scrapped his plans of building a railroad onto Mexico; he leaves her office in anger. Right afterwards, a blond employee (Ethan Cohn) enters the office to present his resignation alleging personal reasons; she is distraught, because she thought of giving him a promotion and making him responsible for a whole area. He doesn\'t want to say for whom he\'s gonna work afterwards, but he says it won\'t be for any rival railroad company. She tries offering him a lot of money, but he refuses point blank. He decided to tell her only because he had promised her to give her notice in advance when she gave him his first job. When she presses on for a reason, he just whispers, "Who is John Galt?" The image freezes and the audience can read the following caption: MISSING: OWEN KELLOGG - TAGGART EXECUTIVE - VANISHED: OCTOBER 15, 2016.\n\nDagny is worried, drinking by herself. She phones Henry, talking about the dissapearance of several efficient men. Henry was also sleepless, having a cold relationship with his wife.\n\nRichard McNamara (Jack Milo) is at the train station, waiting from somebody from the Taggart Transcontinental to pick him up. He is stopped by somebody who offers him to have part on a society based on individual achievement. The image freezes once again and reads MISSING: RICHARD McNAMARA - MANUFACTURING CEO - VANISHED: NOVEMBER 6, 2016.\n\nJimmy proposes to take the flag of caring for the general wellness, but instead getting the competition out of Colorado. He is praised as "behaving as a politician".\n\nNews of the Mexico government, who has just nationalized all gold mines. Francisco and the Taggart Transcontinental have lost billions. In a corporate meeting, James says that he has saved the company billions by letting only a train a day running towards Mexico. Eddie is the one who spreads the news. The person Dagny is looking for called the company and only said "Who is John Galt?"\n\nThe CEO of company who used to work with a rival train company who has just closed down shouts at Dagny. He says he only needs affordable transportation and leaves without shaking the hand she offers.\n\nDagny talks to Henry: she needs stronger engines and faster trains. He mentions a company which went bust which had the best engines. He intends to look for the remains of the company to see whether there is something which could be salvaged. He also invites her and James for his anniversary party. Dagny throws some water to Francisco at a luxurious restaurant: he knew everything about the Mexican takeover but did nothing to prevent it, saving himself but nobody else.\n\nLillian is taking Henry to their anniversary party. Barb Branson (Latasha Muhammad) from the NNT talks about the new bill which Orren had approved. Henry is worried and wants to deal with the matter, but Lillian doesn\'t want to hear about business. Dagby compliments her on her beautiful bracelet, but Lillian desmisses it as always. Henry doesn\'t want to talk to Francisco, who was invited by Lillian. He is surrounded by many girls.\n\nJames drinks on his own. Another man tells him that happiness is a delusion. Francisco talks to Henry; he wants to learn from him, and he says that the people at the party don\'t want to admit that they are in debt with Henry, who is the provider of them all. Dagny prises Lillian\'s bracelet once again. When Lillian says that she was thinking of giving it to the maid, Dagny offers to exchange it for her diamond necklace, and Lillian jumps to this opportunity, doing it remorselessly in front of Henry himself. After the party, Henry tells Lillian never to invite people she thinks they are his friends. She replies back that he has not friends at all. He also rejects any possibility of sex with her.\n\nRebuilding of the Colorado railtrack is on its way. Dagny decides to let Jimmy defend the bill on his own. She leaves the limo and walks home. The streets are full of bumps.\n\nRearden metal is deemed good, but Dr Potter (Armin Shimerman) is pulling the gears to make the public opinion believe that it\'s dangerous. Dr Potter offered to buy the formula of Rearden metal, but Henry refuses, as it is his. He says that Dr Potter would not understand.\n\nWyatt and Dagny are on site, checking the works on Colorado. He offers a job to her, in case that she needs it. Henry is also there, checking on an old bridge which should be replaced. He will do it in three months, and she says that it will depend on the budget.\n\nEddie tells Dagny that another key employee has quit. She tells Eddie to stand on their own. James in playing with an electric train. Dagny wants to leave the company and start another company which will end the Colorado works. Then, she will come back to Taggart Transcontinental. She will take Eddie with her, so that James will have to do "his own job" from that moment on. She tells him to behave, or she will destroy him. She says she will call the line the John Galt line.\n\nDagny asks Francisco for the money, but he won\'t give him the money. She explains the name as her being fed-up of hearing the name. She is rejected by many investors. Finally, she gets four people. Henry himself will put the remaining funds. Henry shows her some photographs of some kind of engine: it was hidden in the bankrupt company in Winsconsin he dug around. It is a prototype which probably was never put onto production, so nobody can be sure that the thing even works properly, but Dagny feels that the engine is worth a look. Henry is interrupted, being told that the "equality of opportunities" bill has been passed, forbidden that nobody should have more than one company. Henry insists that he will sell all his other companies, but that he will never give up his metal. He reassures Dagny that that the bridge will be done on time and budget. Henry has to sell his companies to some other people, like for example Paul.\n\nRearden Ore Corporation, Rearden Coal Company, Rearden Foundry Inc, Rearden Manufacturing Itl... they all go one by one. That\'s not the only problem: Union leader Brenden Brady (Matt O\'Toole) alleges the unsafety of the rearden metal to try to forbid that any union member works on that line. Dagny will asks for volunteers, but she wants Brady to give the workers a choice. She promises that the speed will be kept steady for all the itinerary. She and Henry go on the new train. Before boarding, Dagny is asked who John Galt is. Many people look at her on the tv, worried about what she\'s going to say. She simply answers "We are". The train is able to cross the bridge, and they breathe out after they cross the bridge. 300 miles in less than 90 minutes, she announces confidently upon arrival.\n\nOn the small celebration party it\'s mentioned by Wyatt that a new oil spring has been found, and that when everybody wants to go there to work on the site, their company will be the one who will take people there. At night, Henry and Dagny are left alone. They make love.\n\nAt that moment, there is a knock on the door. A figure with a hat enquires about Ellis Wyatt, and he himself oepns up the door. When he finds it strange to be called upon at that hour, he asks who he is. The hatted man says that he knows his name.\n\nHenry proposes a getaway trip to Dagny to see the 20th Century Motor Corporation, a derelict building in Starnesville, Wisconsin. The warehouse is empty, apart from a few loose pices here or there. Dagny says that it looks as if they just left away. Henry finds a kind of hidden room: it\'s full of designs of engines. There is even an abandoned prototype. The designs are not signed, so they try going to the city hall and getting a list of employees, but they are incomplete in the town of Rome. A retired man leads them to one of the old employees who is working in Washington. In spite of Henry saying that he doesn\'t support Munch anymore, Eugene Lawson (Rob Brownstein) leads him to an engineer. He gives him a surname: Starnes. In Durance, Louisiana, his daughter Ivy Starnes (Sylva Kelegian) says that his father was an evil man, who only cared about motors and engines. She leads them to Brandon, Wyoming, where the chief engineer used to leave; he had quit the day after the engine project was presented to the company. His widow, Mrs Hanstings (June Squibb), says that it was his late husband\'s assistant who designed the engine. She leads them to Hugh Akston (Michael O\'Keefe), the young assistant\'s university professor and mentor, who now has a lower station in life, being the owner of a humble diner in a dusty town. Akston doesn\'t want to even say the name of his proteg, and, to Dagny\'s surprise, he mentions that the mystery she\'s trying to solve is much greater than only an engine which creates electricity out of a vacuum.\n\nEddie tells Dagny that there are new problems: some estates are forbidding the train with metal to pass throughout, and the use of the Rearden metal is being forbidden. Dagny tells Jimmy to fight his own battles, but we can see clapping to Wesley Munch\'s press conference. There, Munch also announces that steel companies will have to distribute the steel equally between companies, that companies will be forced to stay in their states and can no longer move to richer states like Colorado, and that Colorado will be imposed a special tax so that there will equalize economy in all the states.\n\nWe can see Henry Rearden, alone, on his office, with a sad face, probably feeling desperate. Dagny drives like crazy to Ellis Wyatt\'s mansion. The chief fire-fighter (Derric Nugent) cannot prevent her entrance to the now empty mansion. She calls out for Ellis, but he\'s not there. He leaves the home and goes up a small steep nearby, from which she can see all the oil springs burning to exhaustion. She screams NO! There is a placard to her left side, which says I\'M LEAVING IT AS I FOUND IT. TAKE OVER. IT\'S YOURS. Dagny falls to his kness.\n\nWe can hear the conversation in off of Ellis Wyatt to the same voice of the shadowy man which this time recognises that he be John Galt (Paul Johansson). He talks to Wyatt of the country where he comes from, called Atlas. There, individuals are judged on their merit, and the government don\'t crash them. Energy, intelligence, innovation and money are respected and appreciated there.\n\nWe can see the following notice: MISSING: ELLIS WYATT - OWNER WYATT OIL - VANISHED: JULY 23, 2017. Over it, we can hear an answering machine message by Wyatt. He says that he\'s done, and that he\'s going on a strike.\n\nFade to credits.\n\n--Synopsis written by KrystelClaire']

['At the start of the game, Jack (the character controlled by the player) is a passenger on a plane that goes down in the Atlantic Ocean in 1960,[37] after ordered society in Rapture has collapsed.[38] After surfacing, Jack finds himself the only survivor of the crash, and swims to a nearby lighthouse, where he finds a bathysphere which he uses to descend into the ocean and enter the failed "paradise" of Rapture.[39] Atlas assists Jack via radio in making his way to safety, while Ryan, believing Jack to be a government agent (though he\'s not sure which government), uses Rapture\'s automated systems and his pheromone-controlled Splicers against him. Atlas tells Jack that the only way he can survive is to use the abilities granted by plasmids, and that he must kill the Little Sisters to extract their ADAM. Overhearing Atlas\' words, Dr. Tennenbaum intercepts Jack, and urges him to save the Little Sisters instead. She gives him a special plasmid that will kill only the embedded slugs while leaving the girls alive and restoring their humanity, albeit with a much smaller reward of ADAM for Jack. Tennenbaum promises to repay him if he does as she asks.[34] As Jack works his way through the city, he learns about Rapture\'s fate and history through audio logs, genetically-induced ghostly playbacks of past events, and radio messages. Atlas says his wife and child have been hiding on a submarine, and just as Jack and Atlas reach the bay where it is located, Ryan has it destroyed; an enraged Atlas tells Jack that Ryan must die.\n\nJack makes his way to Ryan, who offers no resistance to Jack\'s efforts, but instead reveals why Jack has come to Rapture: Jack was actually born in Rapture a mere two years ago, genetically modified to mature rapidly. He is Ryan\'s illegitimate son by an affair with Jasmine Jolene, an exotic dancer.[35] Ryan further reveals that, after purchasing Jack\'s embryo, Frank Fontaine designed him to obey orders that are preceded or followed by the specific phrase "Would you kindly". Jack was then sent to the surface when the war started to put him beyond Ryan\'s reach. When the conflict between Atlas and Ryan reached a stalemate, Jack was sent instructions to board a flight with a package. At a designated time he opened the package to discover a gun and instructions to hijack and crash the plane next to the lighthouse, enabling him to return to Rapture as the cat\'s-paw of Atlas. Ryan calmly demonstrates Jack\'s lack of free will by forcing him to follow his commands using the trigger phrase, "Would you kindly...", which Jack then realizes Atlas has been using since his arrival. Ryan then orders Jack to kill him, so as to die on his own terms. Atlas, in complete control of the city as a result of Ryan\'s death, reveals himself to be Frank Fontaine, having faked his own death and adopted the alias and persona of Atlas to throw Ryan off his trail. With Ryan dead, Fontaine no longer needs Jack, and leaves him at the mercy of the reactivated security systems. Nevertheless, Dr. Tennenbaum and her Little Sisters help Jack escape through the vent system, where he falls and loses consciousness.\n\nWhen Jack awakes, Dr. Tennenbaum has already deactivated some of his conditioned responses and assists him in breaking the remaining ones, among them one that would have eventually stopped his heart. During their subsequent pursuit of Fontaine, the doctor predicts that the only way to get through the last few obstacles would be to assemble a Big Daddy diving suit and follow the rescued Little Sisters through the passageways that only they can open. By the time Jack reaches him, Fontaine has injected himself with vast amounts of ADAM, becoming an inhuman monster. Jack and Fontaine battle, and Jack eventually prevails, allowing the Little Sisters to subdue Fontaine, by swarming over Fontaine and stabbing him with their needles, killing him by draining all the ADAM out of his system. Here the game ends.\n\nThree endings are possible depending on how the player interacted with the Little Sisters, all narrated by Dr. Tennenbaum. If the player rescued all the Little Sisters (therefore saving their lives), the ending shows the rescued Little Sisters returning to the surface with Jack and living full lives under his care, including them graduating from college, getting married, and having children; it ends on a heart-warming tone, with an elderly Jack surrounded on his deathbed by all of the adult Little Sisters. If the player harvested (and therefore killed) more than two, but not all, of the Little Sisters, the game ends with Jack turning on the Sisters after defeating Fontaine, presumably killing them all and taking their ADAM. Tennenbaum\'s voice narrates what occurred, condemning Jack and his actions. Later in the second ending, a ballistic missile submarine carrying a nuclear missile comes across the wreckage of the plane and is suddenly surrounded by bathyspheres containing Splicers. The Splicers kill all hands aboard the submarine and take control of it.[40] If the player harvested all of the Little Sisters, the player is shown the same movie as the second ending, though the tone of Tennenbaum\'s voice is angrier.[41]']
['July 6th, 1912, Booker DeWitt is a New York Pinkerton detective and Wounded Knee veteran given a curious task, to deliver a young girl to a client in New York, under the instruction of their representatives, the Lutece twins, Robert and Rosalind, they are extremely intelligent. His only lead is a picture of the girl, Elizabeth Comstock, whom has a missing right pinky finger that is covered with a thimble, bearing the message "Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt." The Luteces row him to a lone lighthouse off the coast of Maine.\n\nBooker ascends the lighthouse alone to the top where he steps into a rocket chair that propels him through the clouds to a floating city called Columbia, a seemingly idyllic and technologically advanced civilization, on the day the city is celebrating the anniversary of Columbia\'s secession from the union of States. The leader is a religious figure, Father Zachary Hale Comstock. Booker spots a poster warning of a "false shepherd" that will take Columbia\'s "lamb," the shepherd is recognized by the letters \'AD\' on the back of his right hand, as it happens, Booker has those exact letters carved on his right hand. Booker enters a fairground competition and discovers that race relations on Columbia are just bad on the surface, as he\'s won a prize to throw a ball at an interracial couple, here the player can choose to throw the ball at the couple or the host, Jeremiah Fink. Before throwing the ball at either, Booker is detained by police as they\'ve spotted the telltale letters on his hand, Booker fights through the police and eventually makes it Monument Island where Elizabeth is held.\n\nNaturally, she mistrusts a complete stranger offering to take her away, he offers to take her to her dream location of Paris, yet their escaped is hampered by the arrival of Songbird, a giant mechanical bird created with sole purpose of keeping Elizabeth in Columbia. Booker and Elizabeth narrowly escape dying during a plummet in the beaches of Columbia\'s Battleship Bay. They recover and spot a blimp floating overhead, The First Lady, their escape vessel. Getting to it however requires an item from the Hall of Heroes, dedicated to Columbia\'s accolades and Comstock\'s actions at Wounded Knee and the Boxer Rebellion. Booker was at Wounded Knee and remembers nobody called Comstock. On an elevator ride to the hall Elizabeth displays an ability to open tears to other dimensions.\n\nOnce aboard the First Lady Booker sets a course for New York, which Elizabeth notices as she spent most of her time in the tower reading many educational books, he explains his real reasons for freeing her and she knocks him out, when Booker regains consciousness, the airship is now occupied by the Vox Populi, a resistance group of Columbia\'s downtrodden minorities and their leader, Daisy Fitzroy, formerly a scullery maid to the Comstocks, wanted on suspicion of murdering First Lady Annabelle Comstock. Fitzroy will hand the airship over to Booker and Elizabeth in return for a supply of weapons from a Chinese gunsmith, Chen Lin. Booker is thrown off the ship and finds Elizabeth again, she mistrusts him, but since he\'s her only means of getting to Paris, she\'ll help him.\n\nThey head to Finkton, the Jeremiah Fink run industrial district, they head to Chen Lin\'s gun factory where his Chinese wife says the police took him to the Good Time Club for interrogation. He\'s found in the basement dead, a surprise appearance from the Lutece twins suggest Elizabeth use her powers to enter a dimension where Chen might be alive, they do so and find Chen at the factory in a strange state of alive and dead at once, due to one version of him being killed in an alternate timeline and that here he was spared because he was married to a Caucasian woman with ties to Finkton police. Chen\'s manufacturing equipment is being held at the police station, which means going through the Shantytown. Once at the station Elizabeth opens a new tear to a different Columbia, where Elizabeth was taken from Monument Island shortly after Booker\'s arrival and he joined the Vox Populi to further his task, but here died and is revered as a martyr for the current Vox revolution.\n\nThis knowledge causes Booker to suffer a spontaneous nosebleed, he and Elizabeth fight alongside the Vox to the First Lady, however Fitzroy only knows the Booker that died for the revolution and regards this new living version an imposter, the Vox turn on him. Booker and Elizabeth witness Daisy shoot Fink in cold blood and she takes his son hostage, Booker distracts her while Elizabeth sneaks behind Fitzroy and stabs her with a pair of scissors. They reclaim the First Lady and set off for Paris, only for Songbird to crash the ship into Emporia financial district.\n\nAn impromptu appearance from the Lutece twins provide information on Songbird\'s control mechanism, a specialized flute that plays a programmed tune, then they disappear. The leaderless Vox Populi are running rampant, killing civilians and destroying everything, many civilians are evacuating. They must make for Comstock House, yet cannot enter without specific authorization. Only the late Lady Comstock can provide it, they find her air-tight coffin at the cemetery, yet Comstock employs a siphon which drains some of Elizabeth\'s power to resurrect Lady Comstock in spectral form and attack them. They repel her, another appearance from the Lutece\'s explain that they must find tears to learn facts about the Comstocks.\n\nIn the tears it\'s revealed that due to the tears, Comstock was plagued with sterility and rapid aging and Elizabeth was not his child, but taken from another dimension, he had both his wife and the Luteces killed to hide this knowledge. With these details Elizabeth puts Lady Comstock to rest and they are gained access to Comstock House.\n\nAs they cross the bridge, Songbird attacks Booker again and almost kills him until Elizabeth intervenes, surrendering herself so Booker will be spared, Songbird takes off with Liz. Booker pursues them across the bridge and runs into a large tear that lands him in a snowy Columbia, Booker ventures on through the creepy surroundings only to find an elderly Elizabeth. They are overlooking New York City on New Year\'s Eve, 1983, when Columbia is attacking the surface. In this timeline, Elizabeth was indoctrinated into continuing Comstock\'s ideals and brought Booker to show him, furthermore, Songbird thwarted every attempt he made to rescue her, she provides him a card which shows how to control Songbird then sends him back to 1912 six months later. Booker enters the operating room where Elizabeth is being tortured and overloads the machines that grant her enough power to summon a tornado to destroy the room.\n\nTheir new goal is to kill Comstock and Songbird, which means boarding his personal airship, the Hand of the Prophet. Comstock is confronted in his cabin and he directs suspicion to Booker regarding Elizabeth\'s missing finger, Booker manhandles Comstock and drowns him in a baptismal font, this causes Booker to have another nosebleed. They continue to the deck, Elizabeth obtains a whistle that enables control over Songbird, it is used to wipe out the last of the attacking Vox Populi and destroy Monument Island statue which contains a siphon that restrains Elizabeth\'s full power. The destruction of the siphon damages the whistle and Songbird turns toward them, Elizabeth opens a large tear into the underwater city of Rapture. Songbird is trapped outside in the ocean and is crushed under the pressure.\n\nThey ride a bathysphere to the surface lighthouse, through the door they enter a sea of lighthouses where alternate versions of Booker and Elizabeth are concluding their adventures. Elizabeth\'s now unrestrained power has granted her omniscience and a view into Booker\'s past. During the battle of Wounded Knee Booker committed many atrocities for which he felt guilt for, he attended a baptism, but he back out at the last minute as he felt it wasn\'t enough to erase the damages done. Later he would marry, his wife would give birth to a daughter named Anna in 1893, but the woman died during birth. Booker fell into a state of depression and squandering, putting himself in debt, until the Luteces appeared with the offer to "bring the girl", Booker complied but changed his mind and ran to a street where Comstock was stepping through a tear to his reality, Booker tried to grab Anna back but lost her, as she went through the tear closed on her right pinky finger, severing it.\n\nElizabeth was Anna, a part of her in one world gave her the ability to create tears. After the Luteces were killed, versions of them were spread across realities, which allowed them to find Booker in 1912, in a worse state after losing Anna, having carved the letters \'AD\' on his hand, they offered him a deal, their real goal was to return Anna to her real father, knowing she would one day destroy the world. They bought Booker to Maine through a tear, however entering the tear caused paradoxes that erased Booker\'s memory, making him believe it was just a typical assignment.\n\nBooker apologizes to Elizabeth for giving her away and that they can move on, but there\'s more to it than that. Comstock will always exist in other universes, they must remove the source of him. Booker is taken back to the where he was almost baptized surrounded by many alternate Elizabeths, in one timeline he refused, but in another he took the cleansing and was reborn, as Zachary Hale Comstock. Booker lets the Elizabeths drown him, erasing all versions of Comstock and as he drowns the Elizabeths disappear one by one.']

['Matt Winslow moves with his wife, Patricia, and children, Chrissy and Robert, to an upper-middle class suburban neighborhood in Southern California from the Midwest. Matt, an engineer, has taken a new job at Micro-DigiTech, a technology corporation housed in a large, windowed skyscraper near town. His new project entails a thermally-reinforced state-of-the-art space suit. Upon arriving, they are met by their friends, Mary and Tom Peterson, who also live in the community.\n\nThe Winslows are soon met by Jessica Jones, a local insurance agent and director of the Steaming Springs Country Club. At work, Grace, the secretary, attempts to give Matt a binder of secret information, and is replaced by a new secretary mere days later. Matt receives increasing pressure from his boss and peers to join the Steaming Springs club, which Tom and his family have already joined. The overt pressure to become members perturbs Matt, while Patricia suggests that they join, as it may help ensure Matt\'s professional success.\n\nPatricia decides to join the club herself along with Chrissy and Robert; the three are admitted by Jessica in a ceremony in which they enter a mysterious mist-filled room, described by Jessica as "the spring." Matt receives a phone call from Grace\'s husband, Walt, a veterinarian, who informs Matt that Patricia brought the family\'s dog Albert to him, claiming it was violent and suffering from a brain tumor, and wanting it euthanized. After finding the dog had no medical problems, Walt kept the dog, lying to the insistent Patricia that he would euthanize it.\n\nWhen Matt confronts Patricia-now donning a glamorous outfit similar to that of Jessica-about her attempt to have Albert euthanized. She grows manic and pleads with Matt to spend more time with her and the children. Matt is notably disturbed by his family\'s change in behavior, including that of the children. Later, Matt learns from Walt that Grace died in a mysterious car accident. On Halloween, while a party is occurring at the country club, Matt manages to break into the "spring," and uses a thermometer to find that the room is inhumanly hot. A security guard subsequently attacks him, but Matt kills him by electrocution.\n\nReturning home, Matt finds Chrissy in a violent state; he locks her in a closet, but is attacked by an equally vicious Robert. Patricia appears and attacks Matt with a golf club, but he incapacitates her. Matt returns to DigiTech to retrieve his space suit, but is confronted by Tom, who threatens him with a pistol. Matt kills Tom using a laser gun built into the arm of the space suit.\n\nMatt arrives at the party dressed in the space suit, which conceals his face; he presents himself as Tom, altering his voice. Jessica is immediately suspicious, and follows Matt as he sneaks into the spring. Using a flamethrower function of the suit, Matt encircles Jessica in fire before entering the spring. Inside, he finds the temperature rising to excesses of 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit; he soon realizes he has entered hell. Matt leaps from a precipice toward a cityscape below, where he finds himself in an alternate dimension that is a doppelgnger for Steaming Springs. In his house, he finds Patricia madly playing piano. Jessica informs Matt that his entire family is locked within a force field and cannot leave. Matt defiantly removes his suit and enters the force fields surrounding his family, which he is able to do as his actions are out of pure love; this enrages Jessica, who explodes in a beam of light.\n\nMatt and his family awaken in their house, back on earth. Outside, the streets are filled with sirens, and neighbors inform them that the country club has burned to the ground. The family watch from the street as smoke rises from the hillside.']

He refused to go along with them and Gila, who has taken to Flint, is sent to become a Pleasure Unit (because she is a traitor) but she quickly gives Flint back his multi-purpose Cigarette lighter so he can overcome (the evil guys).\n\nFlint then goes on a rampage and releases Gila from conditioning, along with his bounty of girl servants who have also been conditioned to serve.\n\nFlint destroys the complex and makes a high jump off a cliff into the water that, according to Mr. Cramden, has to be a world record and saves the day and gets the gorgeous girl, Gila (play by Israeli Actress Gila Golan).\n\nBang, bang, boom, boom, the world is saved by Flint!\n\nOutstanding musical score by Jerry Goldsmith!']
