# Assignment 2: Analysis of Utopia & Dystopia Movies on IMDb

## Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed similarities and differences related to movies about utopias and/or dystopias. The motivation to that is my LTA class, which is about that them, and has shown me how thin the border between these ideas can be. The data source was the `cinemagoer` package, which provided a range of information about movies and allowed to query on my 2 chosen keywords. The study consisted of analysis across the two categories, be it genre frequency, most common words in the movies' plots and synopsis, and plots' sentiment analysis.
